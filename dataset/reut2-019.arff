{0 'Australia\'s economy should manage modestgrowth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown butunemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. The organisation\'s latest half-yearly report says GrossDomestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pctin 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will behelped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demandfollowing tax cuts and higher real wages, it added. The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumerprices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988. The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightlyand could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,however, the report revises downwards the OECD\'s earlier growthforecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct. The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economicgrowth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which isstruggling to recover from a major economic crisis.

{0 'Robert Fildes, president and chiefexecutive of Cetus Corp <CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corpis not interested in buying Cetus. Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus afive pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs. \"This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a majormajority holder in Cetus,\" Fildes told Reuters in an interview.\"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that theywant to acquire us and we wouldn\'t be interested in that kindof arrangement,\" said Fildes. Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late commentsby Fildes. Squibb is Cetus\' first pharmaceutical partner and the onlyone to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co <EK>and W.R. Grace <WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, butneither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes. Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnosticproducts and with Grace to develop agricultural products. Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to developnew biotechnology products in several fields. As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus\'anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets butnot in North American and Western Europe. \"We wouldn\'t have done this deal had it not been understoodthat Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business inNorth America and Europe,\" said Fildes. He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has amajor joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of itsown in that market. Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements withpharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its ownbusiness. Many large corporations have invested in smallbiotech firms. But Squibb\'s investment in Cetus is the first it has madein biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetusbecause it wanted a partner that didn\'t have a relationshipwith a large number of other biotechnology companies.\" Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drugareas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to \"keep thebiggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.\" Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used tobroaden the company\'s reach in such big money making areasas the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatorymarkets. Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus\' researchover the next five years. \"Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research anddevelopment to make it happen, while the equity position partof the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of thispartnership,\" said Fildes.

{0 'Finance Minister Michael Wilson said taxreform will not affect his determination to reign inexpenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the declinein the budget deficit in the late 1980s. \"Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,\"Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons. Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrsin the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as heforecast in the February budget. And in the year ended this past March, the deficit wasexpected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said. Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal yearhigher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm incomesupport programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipatedrevenues. But finance department documents show the pace of deficitreduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and thetransition to the reformed taxation system. The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs infiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1billion dlrs in 1991. Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadianeconomy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pctthis year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by anactual 3.1 pct. Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at aroundthe current four pct level over the next two years. Reuter',1 GNP}

Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrsto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 forthe week ended June 1, this means the nation\'s money supply hasfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,economists said. \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivanof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator ofeconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concernedthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growthin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seenas better gauges of economic growth. Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, bothmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed\'s5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.

No,\" Sullivan said. \"But does this mean the endof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.\" Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowingsof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement periodwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed hadtargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs. But they said that if it had not been for a large one-daynet miss in the Fed\'s reserve projections, the higherborrowings target would probably have been reached.

The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raisedits share of (P.T.

The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas EconomicCooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen. Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company\'s 320 billion yendebt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciationof the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold indollars. Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago toabout 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even ifprices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.

Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales toThaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS> unit, to less than20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonneaverage, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters. He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to letthe temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exportedtin lapse on June 3. The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct thismonth from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lowerlevels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aidthe tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985. Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet alarge portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100tonnes per day. As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated bythe Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the yearending February 1988. Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC toallocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.

The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministersin December last year pegged the group\'s crude oil output at15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18dlrs a barrel. Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December tojust above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analystsfirmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreementto keep the market stable. \"I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position tostrengthen the gains we have made so far,\" Lukman said. He declined to say if the current ceiling should bemaintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December. \"Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by ourcollective will to keep the market strong,\" he said. He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeksago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and thiswas significant for its members.

{0 'More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyersfixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makesthe same monthly payment no matter what happens to otherinterest rates. And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels inyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyerstrying to lock into cheap money. The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officialssaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the homemortgage business. While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., Theywere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only afew years ago. But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as lowas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in theirportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct toinduce them to retain their accounts. As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or wereforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whoserates would move in line with the cost of funds. \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\"said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,explaining why his institution, for the time being, is onlyoffering variable rate mortgages. The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helpedhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lendersconcede they are being forced to undercut each other stillmore. Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlierthis week by the nation\'s two largest building societies and byNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition fornew business, officials at all three institutions said. The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates evenbelow those on the variable rate loans. \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variablerate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, whichearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed ratenew mortgage loans. But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitableloans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to ourmortgage product.\" Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixedrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year. The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans wasexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman. \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, notingthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pctof its 1986 volume. In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that theyoffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interestrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made thelender is earning an above average return on assets. But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has wonthe benefit of cheap money. Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixedrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumptionthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market ratesfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director. Young explained that the company had planned to protectitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying acomplicated hedging instrument. But money market rates have risen contrary to expectationsand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. Hesaid money market rates were too high to arrange both themortgages and hedge profitably. However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co doesmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. Thismeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bondand selling them to an investor. For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and moreefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating ratemortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popularagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage moneyover the past few years. REUTER',1 INTEREST}

{0 'U.S. crude oil prices are at theirhighest level in more than a year ahead of next week\'s OPECmeeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect anypolicy changes from the session. They said prices, which have steadily climbed since theorganization\'s accord in December, have risen on technicalfactors within the market and concerns about supplies becauseof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from theGulf. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is tradingaround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York MercantileExchange\'s energy futures and in the spot market. That is itshighest level since January 1986. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria\'soil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna tobe brief and calm and that OPEC\'s current price and productionagreement may only need a slight review. Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmationof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due toa desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises. Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soonafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increasedtension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC\'s policies, pricesshould begin easing. \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn\'t already agreedto in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, avice president at Merrill Lynch Futures. OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group\'s production ceiling to16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mlnbarrels in the fourth quarter. This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, risingfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December. Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and areduction in output. \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues totrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance thatOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said NaumanBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, suchas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy. \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in theofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, arecommitted to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua,analyst with L.F. Rothschild. However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meetingin September to re-evaluate market conditions. Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in thefourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels aday and Iraq\'s pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, presidentof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation. Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at thismeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs tooffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominatedthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,producers receive less money for their oil. \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\"said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not toproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore actas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a twodlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" hesaid. One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war. \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the PersianGulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurites. Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have beenregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administrationis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of theU.S. flag, with naval escorts. \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisislike this, and just general nervousness over an incident thatcould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.

{0 'Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mlnounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mlnin 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for JohnsonMatthey Plc said.

Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was releasedin London today. Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest furtherincrease in investment buying and may well be cautious. He said South Africa was the most likely source ofadditional supplies and will need to increase output by about500,000 ounces to meet increased demand. The capital investment required to produce the additionaloutput would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the politicalclimate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said. The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,Clark said. \"The very probability of a growth in demand set against themassive investment required for expansion - and that expansiononly being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me toconclude that the price of platinum will be substantiallyunderpinned in the medium to long-term,\" Clark said.

{0 'European coffee roasters and tradershave agreed to propose a new formula for calculatingInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch CoffeeTrade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said. Van Horick, who is a council member of the European CoffeeFederation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting. The new formula is based on six-year moving averages andwould give Brazil, the world\'s biggest coffee producer, anunchanged quota for the remaining two years of the currentcoffee agreement, van Horick said. If accepted by the consumer and producer members of theICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a newagreement, van Horick said. Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year whenprices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster inBrazil. Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers andproducers have been unable to agree on re-introduction. \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in theformula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposalleaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said. \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does notreflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formulabuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almosteveryone.\" Although full implications of the new formula have still tobe worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such asColombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightlyhigher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, ElSalvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said. Because the proposal provides that future quotadistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, itshould also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doingso would automatically prejudice their following year\'s quota. \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at leasta fair chance of being accepted by the producers at theSeptember meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of anew quota formula, \" van Horick said. At the same time much will depend on Brazil\'s attitude. \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. Ifthere is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next twomonths and most other producers favour our proposal, we mightjust get an agreement,\" van Horick added. Reuter',1 COFFEE}

{0 'A group of Latin American andCaribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending inCongress, saying it would curb their exports, slow developmentand hinder its ability to repay foreign debt. Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization ofAmerican States special committee on trade, said he was awareof the large U.S. trade deficit, but added \"the region shouldnot be the one affected by the trade bills.\" He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollarand the budget deficit, and \"it is regrettable to solve it by atrade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.\" Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after twodays of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now inCongress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs. Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly atJapan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,annual trade surpluses with the United States. Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nationswith large trade surpluses last year with the United States,but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2billion dlrs, against Japan\'s of 58.6 billion dlrs. The European Community has also opposed the bills. Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed theReagan Administration\'s opposition to many of the sections inthe legislation, including those to curb imports and to requireretaliation for foreign unfair trade practices. He told reporters the committee would likely mount acampaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debateon the Senate floor, expected next week. Rodriguez said \"the region needs trade to continuedevelopment. We hope this need will not be affected negativelyby trade legislation.\" Rodriguez said: \"we need to keep the market opens -especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreignexchange not only to service the debt but also to continuenational development progress.\" President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation hetermed \"protectionist,\" and his aides now are mounting a effortto water down some of the objectionable provisions in thelegislation.

{0 'President Reagan\'s nominee as toppoliceman for the nation\'s securities markets will inherit anagency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stockprice gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from theglobalization of financial markets. David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor atNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursdayto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities andExchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeedJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a recordsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as itsinvestigators have probed into the most colossal insidertrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed inrecent months as a growing number of well known traders andprominent investment banking firms have been charged withwrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November afterIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street\'s most successful stockspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigatorsand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegalprofits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing newphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred bycomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the SEC\'s ability to enforceU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency\'sreview of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agency\'s enforcement agenda during theadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commission\'s current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone. By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later tobecome the nation\'s 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon\'sfirst term and was Reagan\'s director of the CentralIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

{0 'The Administration asked Congress toreplace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring itinto line with international tariff categories, U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said. The new system will add such items as fiber optics and moreaccurately define new composites, items not widely traded whenthe current schedule was devised some 30 years ago. Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule iscalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meetthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but theyshould pay about the same rates of duties. Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier todeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety ofdiffering systems which they now face.\" He said the new system ended 12 years of multinationalnegotiations to create the unified tariff schedule. Yeutter said government and business moves are based ondata from tariff schedules and the new system will improveknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making. He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards underthe new system, with about half expected to join the system byJanuary 1988. reuter',1 TRADE}

{0 'Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas PipelineCo, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transportnatural gas under the open access rules of the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission, FERC. In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transportcompany, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines alsotransport its own gas to customers. Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co <T> rejected the FERCguidelines, saying it would not offer open access until theregulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces forgas it has bought but could not sell. The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or paycontracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-termcontracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe ascustomers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access. Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week thatTenneco might follow Transco\'s lead and close its pipelines toopen-access because of the take-or-pay issue. But Tenneco today said open access \"is one of the stepsFERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERCis moving the industry through this restructuring now, evenbefore all transitional problems are solved.\" A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposureunder the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figurefor Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines fromLouisiana and Texas up to New England. \"We remain convinced that the most critical transitionalissue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved byFERC in the near future. \"A failure to do so could have grave consequences for theindustry\'s continued ability to provide its customers withreliable natural gas,\" said Tennessee Gas Transmission Copresident R.C.

{0 'The economy faces lackluster growthand the risk of recession this year if the recent improvementin U.S. exports should falter, economists say. Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weaknessin the key housing and auto sectors and could be furtherhampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say. \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strengthto keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said LyleGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage BankersAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official. The Commerce Department said this week that the economygrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, buta U.S. monetary official called it a weak report. Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spendingrose a weak 0.1 per cent. \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \"Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,told Reuters. Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slowbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages. To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boostpersonal income and consumption, he says. \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports tokeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\"Gramley said. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reportersthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was theresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not lastand said the recovery was showing anemia. Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The paceof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored intomonetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will beaccommodative. Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pctforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that ifthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and addto the risk of a recession. Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in Maycame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where aninventory overhang still exists. He says the boost in production came from smallerindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which haveimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar. \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge ineconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of arecession,\" Mauro said. In a speech to financial planners this week, BerylSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted thetrade deficit will continue to improve. \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 andinto 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said. But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence ininflation. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 aftera 1.1 pct increase in 1986. The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oiland energy prices and rising prices for services, he said. \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie getsout of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding hewould like the Fed to tighten credit. A major factor affecting inflation is the value of thedollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, saysa prominent international banker. Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the NationalPress Club that the dollar\'s downward trend against the yen andthe mark will continue for years because the United States isthe world\'s largest debtor nation. The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to afurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief thatthe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.\"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.

{0 'The six basis point rise of the pastmonth in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by aseries of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as thedollar holds firm. \"Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basispoints over the last month, largely over indications thatinflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowingU.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,\" Samuel Kahan, chieffinancial economist with Kleinwort Benson GovernmentSecurities, said. Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength inthe economy during the first quarter, but his concern iswhether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in thelonger term. Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which hasbecome more important to the direction of debt futures than thebeneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy. The median trade expectations for Tuesday\'s U.S. ConsumerPrice Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down1.5 pct, respectively. Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 moneysupply announced this week was \"surprising, much larger thanexpected,\" according to Kahan. \"Unless quickly reversed,\" sucha trend \"will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,\"Kahan said. Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates whichKahan said have \"slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Boardannual targets,\" the consequences could be a hint of economicweakness down the road, he said. Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised forfurther gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,analysts said. September T-bonds \"are up almost six points since about May18,\" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. Septemberbond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93in mid-June, Duggan said. While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide throughchart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwartedabove the 93 level. \"The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be takenout before this activity is anything other than a trading rangemarket,\" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analystBrian Singer said. The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.currency has made little headway of late, analysts said. \"The critical variable remaining in the market is the valueof the dollar,\" Kahan said. Additional influences next week will be possibledevelopments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impactand size of the U.S. budget deficit, \"although these will notbe in the forefront of the market early next week,\" Kahan said. In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refundingauctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday andThursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the resultswith little excitement.

{0 'OPEC\'s agreement to limit output to 16.6mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boostspot prices and enable the group to raise its officialreference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said. \"Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and theofficial price will be 20 dlrs in January,\" a Japanese refinersaid. The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPECmembers such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait andQatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter. Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading asthe market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrsfor Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs forU.K. Brent, traders said. They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked intothe U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs. \"With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will importMideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen thosegrades further,\" said a Japanese oil trader. Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spotmarket has further upward potential in the short term, havingrisen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday. \"You could certainly argue that if New York rose on thatbasis, there\'s no reason for prices to go up again today,\" saidone international oil trader in Tokyo. \"But I think if there\'s any sign of a dip, it will be boughtback up again pretty quickly,\" he added. One oil industry analyst concurred, \"There is no reason toexpect a weak market from now on.\" He said he expected OPEC toraise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9. Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge stronglyin the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members andthe likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer tomaintain steady prices. Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per daycompared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Itsexport capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipelinethrough Turkey, comes onstream in or around September. Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting upto 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said. Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheatingon the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective pricediscounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. Butthey mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act asswing producer, cutting production to compensate for higheroutput by other members or boosting output if spot prices risetoo high too fast. Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mlnbarrels. \"Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so thestockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it risestoo much,\" an oil industry analyst said.

The ministry had written to Norway\'s oil companies andwould now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts. OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 andretained the fixed prices that were set in its December accordbased on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. OPEC\'s first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, andit\'s December pact had provisionally set a third quarterceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourthquarter. Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshorefields, previously said it would continue its output curbs fromplanned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remainedwithin its December accord on output and prices. Norway\'s oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mlnbpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995. The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented sinceFebruary reduced Norway\'s oil output by about 80,000 bpd. Norway\'s Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland fora meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statementon the latest oil production cutbacks. Over the past year several other leading non-OPECproducers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysiaand Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC\'s bid to keepprices stable. Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following anOPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December. Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total exportearnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil priceduring the first half of 1986.

Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the pastsix months because of the mark\'s surge and the cold winter. \"But since April, statistics clearly show that the economyfinds itself on a course of growth,\" he said. \"I expect thisdevelopment to continue in the coming months.\" Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Communitytrade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous. \"For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used byprotectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts,\" he added. \"Thisincludes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as faras possible.

{0 'OPEC output for the second half of 1987,including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mlnbarrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said. Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained itsceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quartersof 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarterlevel of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quartertarget. Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, \"OPEC thirdquarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd whilefourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd\" Ali did not detail what effect he thought these productionlevels would have on prices. Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused toadhere to it and has recently been producing around two mlnbarrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabiaand Turkey. Iraq\'s export capacity will be further boosted whena 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in aboutSeptember. Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf Warenemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369mln in the second half. Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production fromthe Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which hasbeen supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. \"We willnot discuss it. There will not be any change,\" he said. Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and endedSaturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problemsto be adressed. \"We are overdoing it in holding too short ameeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,\" he said. Ali said the problem of price differentials between theprices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properlyat the meeting. Ali said \"The problem of differentials is a real one. Iwould hate to be producing today a light crude and that problemhas not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpricedrelative to heavy crudes.\" Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at thenext OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said\"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not dothe work of another minister.\" Kuwait\'s own crudes range from medium to heavy grades. OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spreadof 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

{0 'The Securities and ExchangeCommission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptlydisclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart atakeover attempt by Campeau Corp. In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and itslegal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and theagency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shoppingcenter developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau\'stakeover offer. Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrson Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo. On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board hadurged rejection of Campeau\'s Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs ashare, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shoppingcenters to DeBartolo, the SEC said. Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who headsthe merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm ofSullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied\'s SECfiling to disclose the talks even though they had resulted insales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said. Securities law requires takeover target companies topromptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets. The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pctof Allied\'s stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs ashare from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headedby DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed atthwarting Campeau, the SEC said. Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in anamended SEC filing, the agency charged. Allied\'s first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover wasmade on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaintsaid. DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle forcontrol of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in Octoberwhen it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutesafter it dropped its hostile tender offer. The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federaljudge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake inAllied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share. The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joiningwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegaltender offer. But the SEC brief was never filed since the case wasdropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo. In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they complywith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future. Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since itbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual andquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt. Reuter',1 ACQ}

The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies ofEurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will nolonger be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, thespokesman said.

{0 'Corporate mergers and acquisitionsin and around San Francisco over the past seven years have hadonly a modest effect on the metropolitan area\'s economy, aleading business-backed organization said. The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 businessfirms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in anine-county area found that San Francisco itself had sufferedsome ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surroundingcommunities had not. Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area leftdue to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, butanother 21 firms were added to the list. Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.During the period, only six located in the city achievedFortune 500 status. Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director ofMcKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the studygrew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriouslyhurt the economic climate of northern California. However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had beenlost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs werecreated during the period. At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greaterrise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the restof the United States and California. Council President George Keller, who also is chairman andchief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a newsconference that the region had difficulties in persuadingcompanies to locate there because of a fragmented localpolitical system. But he said that because of the amenities of living in SanFrancisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in othermetropolitan area. \"It\'s a great place to run a business,\" he added, \"but it\'sa hell of a place to do business with government.\" The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with GulfOil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from therestructuring activity. Among the corporate headquarters lost during the periodwere Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &Cooke and Rolm. Companies that grew enough during the period to make theFortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac. The study by the management consulting firm said that,partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growthin San Francisco has slowed since 1980.

{0 'A North Sea oil find announced by ChevronCorp\'s <CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate anew field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mlnbarrels, industry analysts said. Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 APIcrude oil from the tertiary \"Alba\" sand through a three-inchsurface choke. \"The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320mln barrels,\" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grievesonand Co told Reuters. He said industry estimates put the total reserves at thefield at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity ofoil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25pct. Analysts said the results were encouraging, but thepotential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in thefield was shown by the fact that the first well had to beplugged and a sidetrack drilled. \"The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which willrequire a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costsup,\" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said. Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oilfound would require additional costs in recovery, the test wellshowed that it flows well. \"Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could berecovered,\" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters. However, Chevron officials declined to comment on theanalysts\' reserve estimates. They said that without furtherresearch and drilling in the area this summer, they would notdisclose any reserve figures.

{0 'Pakistani government allowed freercotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimedat narrowing the country\'s yawning trade gap. Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech the government had also decided to allowduty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industrymore competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export ofPakistani products. Cotton and rice are Pakistan\'s main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s. But Haq said now the private sector would also exportcotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets along-standing demand of the local traders. The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed tobring down prices and help the local ancillary industriescompete effectively in the world market, he said. Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years butreviewed every year. It was a departure from the previous practice of announcingtrade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it wouldenable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over alonger period. He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been providedfor the export of engineering goods to selected third worldcountries on soft credit terms. Pakistan\'s 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 percent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86. He said the government policy was to rationalise andstreamline import controls. \"It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, localindustry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,\" hesaid. \"Prices have been on the increase and quality of goodsproduced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave riseto smuggling and hampering of exports.\" He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freedfrom import restrictions. Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely fromremittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in theGulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after thedrop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of abalance of payments crisis for Pakistan. Reuter',1 TRADE}
