{0 'Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf likebeacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night. One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday. The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel andconcrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it. The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one sectionof the structure remained. U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after anAmerican helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said hadbeen caught laying mines. But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defenseofficials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkwormmissiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursdayand the Sea Isle City on Friday. Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, akey backer of Iraq in its war with Iran. Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle Eastnow with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaititankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping. But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the levelof violence and threats to shipping had increased as a resultof U.S. intervention and Iran\'s response. The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of aU.S. \"tit-for-tat\" policy that gave Iran the initiative, saidHarlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS. He said with this appraoch America would suffer \"the deathof one thousand cuts.\" But for the United States to grab the initiativemilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran\'sharbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which itsshipping must pass, Schuler said. He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringingIran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq. Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomaticinitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose anarms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate. He said the United States should also threaten to mine andblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq toacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of asettlement. Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war byinvading Iran\'s territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for theoutbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-styleinfantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties. Each side has attacked the others\' shipping. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps-- such as mining Iran\'s harbors, blockading its shipping, ordestroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war. \"Iran is in the driver\'s seat in an absolute sense as thecycle of attack and retaliation continues,\" said Fred Axelgard,a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic andInternational Studies (CSIS). \"It\'s like a Greek tragedy,\" said retired Adm.

They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy beganescorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, whichPresident Reagan could never accept.

{0 'Recent announcements from Moscow ofnext year\'s grain production targets indicate that the Sovietsare estimating this year\'s grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,Agriculture Department analysts said. USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, butsome earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes. Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst ofSoviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article inIzvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be\"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.\" \"This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213mln tonne (grain) crop,\" the analyst said. In calculating Moscow\'s crop estimate, USDA used the 235mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figurepublished in a Soviet economic journal this month. USDA\'s production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects arange of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said. Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvestprogress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said. While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agricultureofficial Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would beas good or better than last year\'s 210 mln tonne harvest. A member of Nikonov\'s party commented that although 230 mlntonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems wouldbring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes. Reuter',1 GRAIN}

{0 'Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing onworld markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gainsthat followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in theGulf earlier on Monday, analysts said. December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents beforefalling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday. \"Fundamentals are awful,\" said Philip Lambert, analyst withstockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPECproduction in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mlnbpd, little changed from September levels. Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPECproduction could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter andInternational Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC Septemberproduction at 18.5 mln bpd. The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday\'s hit ofa Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the SeaIsle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flagcommercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war. The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in thearea on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile. Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil onMonday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.Attack, analysts said. They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through whicharound eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not inthe interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said. Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase inthe number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulfhostilities, analysts said. But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranianmissile attacks, with some describing it as responsible. Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response. \"The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspondto Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that anyfurther action will be met with a like-for-like response.Today\'s action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,\" Pyne said. Kleinwort Grieveson\'s Lambert said the U.S. Strike was \"aresponsible retaliation,\" with the U.S. Apparently indicating toIran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iranchose to raise the level of conflict. Chase Manhattan\'s Nicol took a different view, however. He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved asArab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose intereststhe U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as aresult of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranianretaliation. The initial upward market move this morning reflected astrong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack whichwas thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missilelaunchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said. The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navyattack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence SecretaryCaspar Weinburger. Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in theGulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it lessserious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,analysts and traders said.

{0 'The Louvre accord on currency stability,which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets sincelast February, appeared in serious danger today as atransatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came tothe boil, foreign exchange dealers said. But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock andbond markets plunged, officials in the major industrialcountries played down the dispute as a bilateral problembetween the United States and West Germany and insisted thatthe currency pact was still alive. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the marketfears when he attacked the rise in West German short-terminterest rates. \"That\'s not in keeping with the spirit of whatwe agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,\"Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He wasreferring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Groupof Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed thepact. Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who bothhave large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economicgrowth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.Agreed to stop talking the dollar down. However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvreagreement was still operative, the West German interest ratemove would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord. \"The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker thathe\'s going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all betsare off in terms of currency cooperation,\" Chris Johns, currencyanalyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said. But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguineview, telling Reuters that \"the exchange market is apparentlyreacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Bakercomment will regret it later on.\" French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted theLouvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers torespond directly to Baker\'s remarks. He called for \"a faithfuland firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to theLouvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.\" Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the BritishTreasury commented on the row. But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despiteU.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, \"this doesnot represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of theLouvre Accord.\" In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executiveof West Germany\'s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said thatfollowing recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.Was still committed to the accord. In a move which the market interpreted as a possiblegesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-termliquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct onMonday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injectedmedium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France alsostepped into the French money market to hold down rates,injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates roseclose to eight pct. Reuter',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'British Sugar Plc was forced to shut itsIpswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acuteshortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to aReuter inquiry Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combinationof very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in thefactory\'s catchment area from harvesting, and last week\'shurricane which blocked roads. The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads arecleared and supplies of beet build up again. This is the first time in many years that a factory hasbeen closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added. Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas. Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by BritishSugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a yearout of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes. Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvestingproblems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintainingits estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, thespokesman said. British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K. The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,is expected to run until the end of January.

Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against aplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures theoutput of a country\'s goods and services. He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes ofgrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscowproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986. Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedmachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization isessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively onworld markets. \"Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,\" saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN. Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987compared with the same period last year. However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase plannedfor the industry for the whole of 1988.

{0 'Today\'s sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks andmatching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but themood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securitiesanalysts and economists said. Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the openingon enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street andthe threat of renewed currency instability. \"I have never experienced anything like this, and I\'ve beenin the business for 20 years,\" said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head ofEuropean research at Union Bank of Switzerland. The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetaryauthorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerpublicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetarypolicy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilisecurrencies was still working, but added: \"On the other hand, wewill not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interestrates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the UnitedStates will raise rates.\" Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) inZurich said: \"The situation is very dangerous. Statements by theU.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates.\" Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank\'sfinancial research department, called the sell-off \"overdone,\"but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banksloosen their monetary policy. \"I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over,\" hesaid. \"The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step inwith an easy money policy, or else there is going to be aneconomic catastrophe. They have to act quickly.\" Wyttenbach said the \"Black Monday\" sell-off was clearlyexaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participationcertificates falling 20 pct in value at one point. But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correctionwould come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investorsonly in time for tomorrow\'s market, when there could beanother, smaller selling wave. \"As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that\'s the key --then we\'ll get a strong movement upward,\" Wyttenbach said. Butthat may not come soon. \"People are simply worried that in America, where the markethas now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,\"he said. \"People are afraid that we\'ll have a recession in 1988.\" Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the currentproblems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. \"We do not have amark problem, we have a dollar problem,\" he added, but said thebiggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. FederalReserve Board, Alan Greenspan. Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that thedollar might be too high in the medium term and that interestrates might have to rise. \"As a central banker he shouldn\'t dothat,\" Wyttenbach said. \"There is a danger that we will fall backinto the 1970s,\" he said. \"We have a real crisis of confidence inGreenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker.\" Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11. Cantonal Bank\'s Fritschi said: \"I\'m relatively optimisticbecause the situation looks too bad.

{0 'Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin toldthe Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned torise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987. In the first nine months of this year, industrial outputrose by 3.6 pct. Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pctagainst a planned 4.1 pct this year. He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year. The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected theharvest this year. Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineeringindustry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedas a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if theSoviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets. \"Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,\" saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan. Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of thisyear against the same period of 1986. This is well below the7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988. Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recentmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended toa large extent on conserving resources better. \"Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources,\" he said. Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Sovietdefence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, thesame as announced last year. Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increasespending next year on medical services, education, pensions andsocial insurance schemes He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than hadoriginally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan.

{0 'South Korea\'s national news agency, Yonhap,said this year\'s current account surplus will near 10 billiondlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for thecountry\'s cheap cars and electronic goods. Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny theYonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its ownfigures later in the week. Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the currentaccount, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled7.03 billion dlrs. This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for thewhole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks withthe International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapidrevaluation of the won against the dollar. The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier. \"Exports in October could be relatively modest due to manypublic holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus willbe well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,\" Yonhap said. The sharp rise in the September surplus came from aresumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previousmonth. More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrestbetween July and September. The South Korean government originally targeted a fivebillion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raisethis to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half exportboom. If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplusseemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the UnitedStates which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit withSeoul last year, government economists said. The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressureat home, has called on South Korea to open more markets toAmerican goods and revalue the won faster. The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year. REUTER',1 BOP}

They said Saudi\'s supply capabilities of LPG, an associateof crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. \"Saudiis a reliable supplier in that sense,\" said one trader. Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia. No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as anLPG supply source to Japan, the sources said. \"Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulfcould easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilitiesin that area,\" said another trader. Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant atAl-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back tocontractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports fromother ports. Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on cruderather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPGsupply disruptions, traders said. They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz wasunlikely because it would block Iran\'s oil shipments. Industry sources said Japan\'s LPG imports will not greatlyrise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at amoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991. Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to liftslightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports fromIndonesia are slated to increase, the sources said. The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases inlarge scale when Japan increases annual imports of IndonesianLPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in theyear ended March 1987, the sources said. But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase downterm purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes onthe spot market, they said. Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under termcontracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct ofJapan\'s LPG imports are from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia\'s state owned oil company Petromin has madesome concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in therecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely theJapanese will accept the offer, the sources said. The Japanese term customers, however, have so far beenunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula toreplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice. Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified byPetromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)of Arabian Light. Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftingsshould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of ArabianLight\'s GSP. Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,the trade sources said. Petromin also suggested that a seller\'s option of supplyingup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject toseller-buyer agreement. Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cutsupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume. \"If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitablebasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,\" saidan official at a major importer. \"Freight costs are higher forcargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to alonger haul and war risk insurance payments.\" Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month tofinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing oncontractual period and volume, which could be very similar tocurrent levels, the sources said. \"When we talk business, wewould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability ofhigh dependence on a single supplier,\" said one.

On Monday, King Baudouin accepted the resignation ofBelgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens\' coalition and askedhim to try to form a new government. Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA(BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourgfrancs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGLdirector Robert Sharfe said. He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week. It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interestrates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements, bankingsources said. However, no new placements are scheduled foranother 10 days. The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp(SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issuesthe interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct. Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in paritywith the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates. On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-monthTreasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgianfranc came under pressure. Private placements in Luxembourg francs have becomeincreasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers,because they carry a relatively low interest rate.

But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over acontroversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes ofthe country\'s already nervous financial markets, bankers said. Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt lastThursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs andinterest rates Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl\'scriticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive placefor foreign investors. \"The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank andFinance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreigninvestors,\" said one economist for a London broker, who askednot to be identified. Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financialpolicy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship tosteer the economy through a particularly difficult time. \"There are plenty of objective pressures which will resultin things getting back to normal again after a period of illfeeling,\" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister. News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pctwithholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds ina market already reeling from rising interest rates at home andabroad. Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way thefinance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting theBundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflictingdetails to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market. Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been underextraordinary pressures lately. Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by hisdeputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fightinflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he hadpursued so far this year to promote currency stability. In recent statements Poehl has sounded more likeSchlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has beenwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supplygrowth would eventually lead to rising prices. Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbankcouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent hisviews, bankers said. \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank\'sPfister. \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is notentirely his own,\" said another economist. The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the markand hurting West German exporters. The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since theBundesbank\'s new tack became clear in early October. Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary JamesBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases. Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany tostimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports. One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a roundof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990. But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult forStoltenberg than he had bargained for. The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly votedmost popular government politician last year, had to faceresistance from local barons in the government coalitionparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts. The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising4.3 billion marks. But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it willpush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs thegovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in. Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political rowwhich has turned into the country\'s worst political scandal. Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington lastmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state ofSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party. The state\'s CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign afterallegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavylosses for the CDU in state elections. Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva lastweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide. Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the moreremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, andwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt. When Poehl\'s contract came up for renewal earlier thisyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl\'s CDU-led coalition governmentgave Poehl another eight-year term. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said hehoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.

{0 'The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nationsstill comply with last February\'s Louvre accord to stabilizecurrencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said. And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s remarks at theweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lowerrange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank ofJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews. \"The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, andanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret itlater on,\" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters. The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk thedollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, henoted. A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved inmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Wouldnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollaragainst the mark or the yen. The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and141.35 yen. \"Behind Baker\'s remark was U.S. Frustration over higherinterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but thisdoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic frameworkof the Louvre accord,\" the Finance Ministry official said. He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid anyfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not onlyhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debtproblem. Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise theirinterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond marketsfurther, the monetary officials said. Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declinedto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a furtherdecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationaryexpectations in the U.S. \"That\'s why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvreagreement is still operative,\" the senior ministry officialsaid. Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday thatWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of WestGermany\'s increase in short-term interest rates. The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollardecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in theaccord, foreign exchange dealers said. But the market on reflection also noted Baker\'s additionalstatement that \"the Louvre agreement is still operative,\" andthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, thedealers said.

Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look atthe accords, said \"I firmly desire a faithfull and firmadherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvreaccords -- in both their letter and spirit.\" On Sunday, Baker said last week\'s rise in short-term WestGerman interest rates was not in keeping with the accords. The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, calledfor stability among the major currencies after a prolongeddollar slide. The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven FinanceMinisters in Washington last month. But Baker said at the weekend that the West German raterise was \"not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.\" \"What I\'m really saying is that they should not expect us tosimply sit back here and accept increased tightening on theirpart on the assumption that somehow we are going to followthem,\" he added.

{0 'International Rubber Organisation(INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests hadshown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, butacknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it. \"We have said all along that the rubber is holding up wellfrom a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored inproper conditions does not deteriorate,\" he told Reuters in atelephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber soldsince he entered the market in September would be discussed atan INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said. Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest inbuying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possiblepoor quality. Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the\"may-sell\' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO\'sfive-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stockwas uppermost in consumers\' minds. \"We have received good interest for the rubber. I understandthe Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubberbefore they carry on buying,\" he said. Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 differentlocations in producing and consuming nations, adding allwarehouses used were suitable for long-term storage. Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during thepast week to 10 days and this could reflect a \"wait and seeattitude\" by buyers, he said. \"Consumers are holding back from buying additional amountsuntil they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,they are likely to buy more.\" Hofmeister said he could reducethe offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interestbut INRO did not want to depress prices artificially. Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimatesthat he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpurand New York since September. But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have anidea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overallhad put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes. The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonnebuffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Councilmeeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday. The current international rubber pact expires on October22. The deadline for the new pact\'s start is January 1989 andHofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber duringthe interim period.

{0 'An income tax surcharge and capitalgains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation ofthe N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said. Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and theBank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed torestore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut bycurrent government policies. The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turnwould lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 couldbe much higher than the government\'s 1.3 billion dlr forecast. Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as apercentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase wasprobably unavoidable, Bayliss said. He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pctvalue-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationaryimpact of a currency depreciation. The government had failed to bring inflation down despitelower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added. New Zealand\'s inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year toend-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June. The major deficiency in the government\'s anti-inflationpolicies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates andinsufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Baylisssaid. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debtand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit. \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand\'s) problems aregoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thoughtis soundly based -- primarily because the government\'smacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.

The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Fridaycloses of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here. The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New Yorkand 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10. The currency\'s decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said. \"The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearishsentiment after Baker\'s comments,\" said Dai-ichi\'s Tanaka. Hesaid this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation amongthe group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement theLouvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying. The dollar\'s fall was also prompted by a record one-daydrop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weaknessin U.S. Bond prices, dealers said. Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but hestrongly criticised West German moves to raise key interestrates. Operators took Baker\'s comment to indicate impatiencewith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accorddue to their fears of increasing inflation. Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationarypressures also slow domestic demand. West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings toboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Tradedeficit, Tanaka said. U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a stillmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interestrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said. \"Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nationscoordinate dollar buying intervention,\" said Soichi Hirabayashi,deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd\'s foreign exchangedepartment. The target range set by the Louvre accord is generallyconsidered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said. \"The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the nearfuture and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nationsfailing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvreaccord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,\"Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as lowas 135 yen soon. REUTER',1 YEN}

{0 'The Soviet Union\'s industrial output isgrowing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign tradehas fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show. Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda showindustrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period. Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2pct. Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billionroubles. Separate import and export figures were not given. One factor affecting industrial growth was the introductionof a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Lastyear\'s calculations of industrial output included all goods,irrespective of quality. Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev\'s drive to modernise the economy, specialinspectors have the right to reject goods they consider belowstandard. Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods wererejected in the nine-month period. The figures also showed that on October 1, there were morethan 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,Pravda said, without giving comparative figures. The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of theeconomy has been an important part of the modernisationcampaign, with measures introduced recently to allow thesetting up of small shops on a private basis. Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine monthsagainst 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986. But western economists said they treat Soviet productivityfigures with caution, as they are more broadly based than inthe West, which measures worker output over a given period. Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Unionas of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same periodlast year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against194 roubles a year ago. REUTER',1 IPI}
