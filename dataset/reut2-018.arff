GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, accordingto a government economic survey. The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentumand there was an impressive performance in a five pointgovernment program for rural uplift, education and povertyalleviation, said the survey. Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a newsconference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstormsdamaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pctcompared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might nowslide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct. The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be ninepct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end. Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, homeremittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrsfrom the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion. More exports and an improvement in the balance of paymentssituation will be required to overcome this declining trend inhome remittances, he said. The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because ofthe boost in exports. He said national investment continued to be small becauseof a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said moresavings were required to maintain or possibly step up thepresent growth rate and to finance the country\'s seventhfive-year development plan to be launched in July 1988. REUTER',1 GNP}

{0 'A representative of the poultryindustry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequentlythe cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products orsalads and other mixed foods. Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industriesand a director of the National Broiler Council, told a HouseAgriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chickenhas not increased in recent years and that chicken is neitherthe major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of anincrease in outbreaks of the disease. May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed thatbetween 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of allU.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pctof outbreaks and dairy products six pct. May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads andmixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods. May said the chicken industry favored moving away frombird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment systembetter able to identify microbial and bacterial contaminationof poultry. However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice forFood and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should beretained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cookchicken to remind consumers about preparation proceduresnecessary to avoid illness.

Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish tradeofficials, said the stable price depended upon output restraintby both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish governmentofficials said. They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, madethe remarks whilst talking about the connection between ThirdWorld debt and industrialised nations. Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higherenergy bills for the world\'s industrial nations, Lukman said. Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around thebeginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrialcountries that depend on imported energy, they would only leadto wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, hesaid. This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely highprices, he added. Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a majorcrisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.

The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last monthby cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and isunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest ratesin the near future, they said. The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting willbe followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT. But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference wasusually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, anddid not necessarily herald any policy moves. Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said todaythere was no reason to cut interest rates because money supplygrowth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar wasstable against the mark. Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank hasopened a representative office, that the West German economywas now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted1/2 to one pct in the first quarter. Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold ina 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after theBundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at aminimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct. \"They have set this signal and indicated they could maybelower market rates even further, but not with the discount orLombard,\" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, saidGerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries andaround historical lows for West Germany. A further cut in rates would have little impact on theeconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said. The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a moveon interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.\"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,\" he said. A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them inline with the new structure of money market rates since lastmonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said. The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted adiplomatic gesture before next week\'s Venice summit. But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made itclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere \"eyewash.\" Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government tocut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetarypolicy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit. But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced taxcuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budgetdeficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further. \"The Bonn government will be in a very weak position inVenice because they can\'t risk increasing the deficit further,\"said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst\'s Hutmann. Bethmann\'s Chrobok said if anything is to happen beforeVenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. \"But Idon\'t expect any convincing measures,\" he said. Money market dealers noted that call money continued tonormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterdayand as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up bymonth-end distortions. Call money could come under upwards pressure later thismonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks onbehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.Two public holidays that week could also distort the market. Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate fundstomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact. But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank wouldallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would notrepresent a tightening of policy, however.

It added the council believed \"an intensification of thealready expansionary stimulation of monetary and financialpolicy is not called for.\" Ost\'s statement said experts believed further pressure onWest Germany to adapt to external economic factors would notincrease. The government regularly uses the term \"changed externaleconomic factors\" when referring to the fall of the dollar,which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officialshave said they expect exports to pick up during the year, butcould still fall below the 1986 level. Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germanyagreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris inFebruary aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar. The stance taken by the experts backs up the officialposition of the West German government ahead of next week\'sseven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to bepressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.

{0 'The White House has completed a newreview of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has notyet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan lastApril should be lifted, U.S. officials said. They said the president\'s Economic Policy Council looked atJapan\'s adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pactyesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly. But there was no hint what the announcement might be. Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to behonoring a portion of its semiconductor pact. But they also noted that the White House has said it wasunlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of theworld\'s seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10. The officials added that while the curbs complicatedU.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was nottaking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit. Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation forJapan\'s failure to honor commitments to end dumpingsemiconductors in world markets at less than production costsand to open its own market to U.S. goods. The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese televisionsets, personal computers and hand-held power tools. Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted assoon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adheringto the pact. reuter',1 TRADE}

In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiaryof Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair. The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with twoCiba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject theSwiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company\'s takeover bid,citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanleyand Co Inc, that it is \"inadequate and unfair from a financialpoint of view to the holders of shares,\" the company said. The board also authorized a special committee and MorganStanley to \"vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize anyalternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders\'investment in the company,\" the company said. Among the alternatives the special committee will considerare a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, includingself tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use ofdividends, Spectra-Physics said. The \"retention plan\" for the 52 top officers will pay anaverage bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said. Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan \"in orderto encourage key operating personnel to remain with the companyduring the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the(Ciba-Geigy) offer.\" Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to theircash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasonsother than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave thecompany because their salaries have been sharply cut. Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigyyesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., chargingit with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading inviolation of securities law and with violating the intent ofJuly 9, 1985 standstill agreement.

It is more than was talkedabout when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here. \"It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believethat getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating theeconomy,\" he added. But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the newsconference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Mightdecide at next week\'s Venice summit to lift its sanctions onsome Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied: \"These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of anagreement that had been reached between the United States andJapan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chipmarket. \"They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to theagreement that it made become evident.\" He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor thesituation for a month and that it was impossible to determine atrend on only one month\'s data.

They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedureslaid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relationsbetween ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affecttrade between the two sides. They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertakingnot to bring in new protectionist measures during the currentPunta del Este round of world trade negotiations being heldunder GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices. The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 Europeancurrency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-producedvegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which couldraise up to two billion Ecus a year. EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at amarathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg onJune 15. Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries areconvinced this would lead to EC industry substituting productsmade within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimatesthis would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in itsmember country exports. \"We can\'t believe the EC would willingly take measures toundermine our countries, but such would be the impact of thesemeasures,\" Wilson said. The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hitby the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if itis approved. Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a verylast resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with othercountries which oppose the plan.

Last year, copper demand was second highest onrecord behind 1984, he said. Phelps Dodge is the nation\'s largest copper company, withannual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year. During the interview, executive vice president DouglasYearley said he believed it was only a matter of time beforethe copper price rose \"because there aren\'t that many newprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,will continue to grow modestly.\" Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound tomore than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a poundrise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings forPhelps Dodge, the company said. \"Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in constructionand other areas,\" Yearley said. New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mineowned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC\'s<BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge\'sown expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by productionshortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.

{0 'With more private investment, not moreprotection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitivewith the most modern foreign producers, analysts from twocongressional agencies said today. The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm ofCongress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearingthere was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason foroptimism than a few years ago. \"While textile producers are making significantinvestments, they could do more,\" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisanbudget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loanguarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather thanincreased trade protection which could lead to foreignretaliation. CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,first imposed in the 1950\'s have had only a small benefit forprofits and investments of domestic firms. Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said theagencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion againstcongressional approval of protectionist textile quotalegislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and otherAsian textile producing countries. President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection billbut it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and isexpected to be voted on in the House this year. However, approval this year is in doubt because passage ofa major trade bill without specific protections for textilesshowed a weakening of support for the legislation. Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreignproducers in the use of modern textile and apparel productionequipment and net imports are growing faster than the domesticmarkets, Kelly said. He added that private investment in the textile andclothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-sevenththe average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct. Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports oftextiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pctwhile U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct. \"The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced bynew technology, imports, or some combination of both. While theindustry may not be able to compete in all domestic marketsthat it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our researchindicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,and that exports can be expanded,\" Kelly said.

{0 'The U.S. meat industry has launched anaggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumerawareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government torelax current beef import quotas. U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrsannually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as highas six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas wereremoved and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of theattributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat ExportFederation said at a press conference today. Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through theAgriculture Department\'s Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan waslaunched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April. \"The promising Japanese beef market could be one of thebright spots for U.S. agricultural exports,\" said Philip Seng,Asian Director for the Federation. \"We supply and they (Japan)buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want tobuy more,\" he said. Seng pointed to Japan\'s beef quota system, which limitstotal Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expandingU.S. beef shipments to Japan. The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavyJapanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreementexpires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to getunderway this fall. The Reagan administration has called for an end to thequotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said theywould not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure. Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters thatthey do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but thatthey hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota. High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected markethas also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industryofficials said. Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrsfor a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat associationsaid. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrsper pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb. Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beefper year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,officials said. Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and adecrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mlntonnes.

{0 'Currency futures are likely to movehigher following the sharp rally today after President Reaganannounced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term asFederal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominatedas his replacement, currency analysts said. Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices betweennow and the June 8 Venice economic summit. In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan\'s attitude tothe dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,analysts said. Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearinga bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks inChicago last week that the dollar\'s recent move upward was atechnical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,analysts said. \"Disappointment of European central bankers over theappointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollarlower,\" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president CarolMackoff. \"The international community will not like thisappointment,\" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy andthat Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought toreduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst DavidHorner. Furthermore, \"that Greenspan was not named two months agosuggests that he was not the Administration\'s first choice --and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,\"Horner said. A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futuresprior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigatedonly by concrete action as opposed to \"jawboning\" at the G-7summit, he said. But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, maybe at an impasse, analysts said. Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neitherplanned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from theU.S. to do so, Mackoff said. The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficitas Japan and West Germany have urged, she said. Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut itsbudget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in thedollar could be forestalled, Horner said. However, \"the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothingchanges,\" Horner said. Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloanesaid European currencies will likely move to the higher end oftheir 1987 ranges after today\'s sharp advance.

{0 'Plans for key reforms of the EuropeanCommunity\'s (EC) controversial farm policy will almostcertainly have to be referred to the bloc\'s heads of governmentat a summit meeting on June 29 and 30, Belgian finance ministerMark Eyskens said today. Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing ajoint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which wasdesigned to help break a deadlock over this year\'s EC farmprice package which has endured since March. Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president JacquesDelors as saying at the same meeting that it would be adisaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks hadto be referred to heads of government. These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine andvegetable fats and oils, and proposals to change the system bywhich EC farm prices, expressed in European currency units(Ecus), are translated into the currencies of member states. The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countrieswhich fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S., Amajor exporter of soybeans to the EC. West Germany, meanwhile, is strongly against the technicalcurrency move, which would result in additional price cuts forfarmers in countries with strong currencies, such as the mark. Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the twoissues are not referred to the summit because this would meanheads of government diverting their attention from much moreimportant world and Community issues. Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were alsolikely to be less sound since they do not usually interestthemselves in such technically complex questions. However, Eyskens said today\'s meeting had thrown up somenuances in member state positions \"which may make the dialoguemore constructive in the next few weeks.\" If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month,the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pctcut in cereals prices, farm trade sources said. It originallyproposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus thisyear, with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops. Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree aprice package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but fortheir disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currencyreforms. The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the needfor budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain ECbudget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year. Although Delors was said by aides to have found today\'smeeting very useful, diplomats said there was little sign of amajor shift in the position of member states, or of financeministers adopting a different line from that of theiragriculture colleagues. The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of thisweek in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge theirdifferences. REUTER',1 VEG-OIL}

{0 'The world\'s zinc mining and smeltingindustry will continue to become more concentrated and moreintegrated in the 1990s, Dr Klaus Goekmann, vice-president ofmarketing and sales for Cominco Ltd, said. Opening a Metal Bulletin base metals conference here,Goekmann forecast the number of individual businesses in theindustry would continue to decline as companies merged orformed conglomerates with increased market shares. At the same time, the conglomerates would become moreintegrated, handling the entire chain from basic ore productionthrough marketing, he added. \"The key to future viability will be flexibility. Prices arelikely to remain at current historically low levels at least inthe medium term, and competition with other metals andmaterials will continue to intensify,\" Goekmann said. \"In the past, we have only reacted to changes in the world\'smarket and economics. In the future, we have to act lessdefensively and more aggressively.\" The industry also has massive overcapacity and this problemhas to be tackled quickly, he added. \"Attempts in the past to cut out this excess capacity inEurope have all failed miserably. However, there is some hopethat current efforts may be successful,\" Goekmann said. At the same time, companies must move to limit theirgeographical and currency risks and become far more marketingorientated, he added. \"With all these changes and rationalization, the industrycan survive to recover its past strength and profitability.Without them, the future does not look very rosy,\" Goekmannsaid.

{0 'Lack of rainfall in recent weeks mayhave affected Ivory Coast 1987/88 main crop cocoa prospects,although good precipitation in the last half of June and inJuly could still reverse the situation, trade sources said. They said the crop is still likely to be fairly large andit is too early to determine the consequences of the dry spellon the harvest. \"This year\'s crop will probably be another good one. It isimpossible to tell how flowering is going, but there should beno problems unless something drastic happens,\" one trader said. Private forecaster Accu-Weather reported today that mostIvory Coast cocoa growing regions were without rain over theweekend and similar weather will persist today and Tuesday. \"Rain would be welcomed, as the past week has been quitedry, except along the western portion of the coast,\" it said. Traders agreed rain was needed, but some noted that the dryconditions had not affected the entire country. The Ivorian Meteorological Office could not be reached forcomment or recent statistics. The trade sources said rainfallin recent weeks was likely insufficient for cocoa plants,although it is difficult to assess what the minimumrequirements are. Trade sources said there had been good rains in lateJanuary, February and March which helped to promote flowering,but April and May were fairly dry in most areas except in thesouth west of the country. The Ivory Coast mid-crop should have been covered byMarch/April rains but the main crop, still in its formationperiod, depends largely on rainfall from April through July. The main rains normally last between May and July, beforereturning again in September/October. \"Flowering has been lessthan normal and if the trees are not carrying that much at themoment, then they have a chance to recover,\" one trader said. Another trade source noted the flowers still had plenty oftime to develop and the rains were \"not good but still not bad.\" The sources said that while the weather might emerge as acause for concern, crop conditions in West Africa werepresently taking a back seat to other factors in theinternational cocoa market. This is not only because of the premature nature of anyharvest predictions but also because of the supply of cocoaalready burdening the market, they said. \"With a third year of surplus overhanging the market and thebuffer stock failing to boost prices despite regular purchases,the weather has not been a factor,\" one private consultant said. London-based dealer Gill and Duffus said in its April cocoamarket report the current 1986/87 Ivory Coast crop was likelyto total 570,000 tonnes, which compares with a record 1985/86crop estimate of 585,000 tonnes.

Denman\'s comments came as the Senate was to begin debatethis week on a major trade bill. \"It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partnersrunning a surplus with the United States should be beaten overthe head if trade barriers objected to by the United States arenot removed within a certain time-scale,\" said Denman in anapparent reference to some of the measures in the congressionaltrade bill. \"If we turn to the path of unilateral action, retaliationand counter-retaliation, the one-world (GATT) trading systemwill very quickly unravel,\" he said. Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was notpurely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations. \"The trade deficit results from a combination ofmacroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit), the exchangerate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry,\"Denman said.

{0 'Bonn is expected to rush throughlegislation this month creating special credits to protect WestGerman farmers from a proposed European Community, EC, paymentsfreeze, government sources said. The new measures are apparently designed to shield WestGerman farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budgetcrisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the ECexecutive commission\'s farm policy reform plans, politicalsources said. EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented jointsession in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate overfuture farm financing. West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commissionattempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxingimports of vegetable oil and fats, for fear of U.S.retaliation. Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetarymechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports. The draft legislation, which the ruling centre-rightcoalition will present to parliament tomorrow, would providetemporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels. The Commission, facing a five billion European CurrencyUnits (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of theyear, has threatened to start phasing out payment of somesubsidies and premiums from August, unless EC member statestake urgent measures to provide fresh funds. West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the newlegislation top priority after last month\'s failure to agree toa farm price package for 1986/87. Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take thesting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidiesby creating a buffer for West German farmers. The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill andallow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1, ahead ofthe summer recess, SPD sources said. SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his partywould support the bill, even though it would further swellmassive government spending on agriculture. He said the billwas an admission that the government believes the farm pricetalks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy. According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters,government authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1billion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies andpremiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer. The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually.But paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks(55 mln dlrs) in interest payments, farm policy sources said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl\'s cabinet is expected to support thebill when it meets tomorrow. Reuter',1 VEG-OIL}

{0 'The West German Government will be askedJune 16 to provide nearly 850 million marks (470 milliondollars) to lay off or retrain 20,000 steel workers whose jobsare threatened by the recent slump in the country\'s steelindustry. Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor HelmutKohl will review a joint proposal by steel employers and tradeunions at a meeting on the ailing industry tomorrow. Both steel employers and union leaders are expected to tellKohl tomorrow that the Government has failed to do enough toprotect German steel firms from subsidies and unfaircompetition from other European Community members. Government sources said Bonn was prepared to take part in acommon effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. Butsince the Government is struggling to finance tax cuts byslashing state subsidies, it is not prepared to pick up thewhole bill for the layoffs, the sources said. A spokesman for IG Metall, the metalworkers\' trade union,said the proposal seeks redundancy payments to 10,000 workersin Ruhr and Rhineland plants. Some 6,000 workers would beredeployed in non-steel making sectors of steel companies,while a further 4,000 would be eligible for job-retrainingschemes. The union estimates that the redundancy payments wouldtotal 600 million marks (340 million dollars), while jobretraining schemes would cost a further 240 million marks (130million dollars). Up to 30,000 West German steel jobs are at risk in the nextfew years following steep losses incurred by the industry sincemid-1986.

{0 'The glitter of gold has generated athree-way competition among the world\'s largest futuresexchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal. When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introducesgold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will gotoe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity ExchangeInc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describeas the world\'s precious metals futures capital forinstitutional business. And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the ChicagoBoard of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when theCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pendingapplication for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-sidewith the CBT\'s smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds)gold futures. The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrumentin July 1986. CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked theexchange to reintroduce the contract because of recentvolatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing thedecision may also have been clearing problems in May whichforced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days inan effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,especially in silver futures. Comex\'s problems may now create a window of opportunity forother exchanges to successfully offer precious metalscontracts, industry sources say. But it is much too early to predict whether other exchangescan inflict serious damage on the Comex\' daily trading volumeof more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments tobuy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs. While average daily trading in the CBT\'s smaller goldcontract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it hassurpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months. \"The climate could not be better for this venture by theCME,\" said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President NeilMcGarrity. \"Everybody is talking about metals now, and interestingdaily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears.There\'s good trading volume in all world outlets,\" McGarrityadded. \"The Merc\'s gold futures would be insurance for dealers,merchants and customers that there would be a market open fortrading,\" if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes theComex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vicepresident and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros.Inc. and a Comex board member. Delivery points vary for each exchange\'s 100-ounce goldfutures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New Yorkwarehouses while the CME contract specifies London deliverythrough a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a memberof the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifiesdelivery from New York and Chicago vaults. The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for anearlier precious metals opening to match the CME\'s startingtime of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier startallows for trading before many important government reports arereleased at 7:30 a.m. CDT. CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities existwith side-by-side trading, noting local interests can begenerated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-termdebt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedgetheir financial risks. \"If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buygold,\" said David Johnson, CME\'s manager of currency products.

{0 'The European Community (EC) executiveCommission will today urgently consider whether to take a newinitiative to break the current deadlock over reform of thebloc\'s farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis. The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following whatdiplomats described as a largely fruitless special jointmeeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue inLuxembourg Monday. Commission officials said farm commissioner FransAndriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to presentfarm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they werefirst announced in March. The most controversial aspects of these proposals are aplan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to financerapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measureswhich would change the way common EC farm prices are convertedinto member state currencies. West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plansfiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats taxplan and modified the currency proposals, there would be achance of agreement on other aspects of the package. These include measures to cut the effective price paid tofarmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct. But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals wouldinclude plans for revising the current oils and fats andcurrency regulations. The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock inmeetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issuescould then be referred to the EC heads of government summit atthe end of the month. Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensurethe summit has ample time to consider proposals for new meansof financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be\"disastrous\" if farm issues had to be discussed by governmentleaders. However, with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year,the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to thetraditionally free-spending farm ministers, diplomats said Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens, who chairedyesterday\'s joint meeting of ministers, said afterwards someaspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have tobe referred to the summit. Although Delors\' aides described the joint meeting asuseful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemedto have merely confirmed member states\' long held positions. Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to havelined up with the four others already opposing the oils andfats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal. Reuter',1 VEG-OIL}
{0 'The growing shift of low-skilledmanufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexican bordercities is not a threat to American employment because it willhelp create new markets for products, according to a studyreleased today. Richard Bolin, director of the Flagstaff Institute ofArizona, which studies international trade issues, said theUnited States needs to encourage the expansion of manufacturingin developing countries so that those nations can becomeconsumers of more U.S. goods. His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen,Texas, for presentation to the International Trade Commissionwhich is gathering information for a report to Congress on whatchanges may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent theloss of jobs and industry. McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted froma trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employfactory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenienttax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods intoMexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products thatare completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant. Bolin said his research indicated that the shift inlow-paying jobs across the border reflected changingdemographics of the U.S. workforce. \"In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be availableto fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will bebetter educated than prior generations,\" Bolin told reporters inMcAllen. \"The jobs in low-tech industries that are being exported toother countries are, for the most part, jobs that we may not beable to fill in the future.\" U.S. employment in less-skilled manufacturing jobs plungedby more than 900,000 between 1977 and 1982, largely due to thetransfer of jobs outside U.S. borders, he said. Americanemployment in high-tech industries increased by 634,000 duringthe same period, he said. But high-tech industries, those in which engineers make upmore than six percent of the workforce, pay higher wages andgenerate more U.S. exports than low-tech businesses, he said. Reuter',1 JOBS}

{0 'OPEC has regained its former role asprice-setter in the oil market following last year\'s price war,acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said. But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand forOPEC oil, adding that market stability will mean a continuedsacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries. Al-Chalabi, speaking at a university here yesterday, saidthe December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr perbarrel reference price gave the market a signal that theproducers\' group was serious. \"It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and thishas restored its credibility,\" said al-Chalabi, who is inCaracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors. Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded theproduction quotas which took effect on February 1 and spotmarket prices are now near or above official OPEC prices. Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basicdilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role, he said.\"The question was, what should OPEC do? Defend the price andrisk losing its market share? Or defend its market share andlet the price drop?\" he asked. \"OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question ishow long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?\" he said. Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC\'s success in shoring upprices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw noquick end to restraint in production. He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oilbecause increased non-OPEC production, combined withconservation and the use of alternative energy sources, hascaused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.

{0 'Government officials said the worst may beover for the Japanese economy, after today\'s news of strongerthan expected growth in the January/March period. But private economists were not so sure and said theeconomy was unlikely to achieve the government\'s 3.5 pct growthforecast in the current fiscal year ending next March. As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/Marchquarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous threemonths. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNPgrowth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86. The government economists acknowledged that the improvedexport performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely tobe repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up twopct from the previous three months. The yen\'s rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/Junequarter, they said. However, given the yen\'s recent stability, stepped-updomestic demand should work as a driving force to push theeconomy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said. Many private economists, though, doubt that the economywill achieve the government\'s 3.5 pct growth forecast for the1987/88 year. Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government\'sforecast, which was revised downwards to three pct lastDecember from an original four pct. Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except forhousing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at MitsubishiResearch Institute. Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth innominal income stays low, he added. The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarterwas simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in thepreceding three months, Takahashi said. Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong butthis was primarily because utility companies brought forwardtheir 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarterof 1986/87 in line with the government\'s economic stimulationpackage announced last fall, he said. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said hewas unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added heexpects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months. Destocking is coming to an end and companies are startingto rebuild inventories, Furuta said. Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lowerinterest rates as well as government policies to stimulate thesector, he said. The government\'s recently unveiled 6,000billion yen economic package will also help the economy.

Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin basemetals conference, Bue said he expected the current talksbetween five smelters including Penarroya to result inintegration between at least some of the companies before 1990. The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, PreussagAg, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB,have 22 pct of the world market, Bue added. \"We have no alternative than to integrate out businessesinto large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throatprice competition and the trend to forward integration from themining companies,\" Bue said. \"It is by no means certain that all the five companiesinvolved in the talks will integrate together. It is quitelikely, and even preferable, that the European smelters formtwo or three large integrated blocs. \"In this way we will be better able to negotiate with ourconcentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers onthe other,\" Bue added. In the past, production overcapacity and the intensecompetition between the European zinc smelters has meant theyhave not only been in a very weak negotiating position whenbuying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling themetal, Bue noted. Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shutdown excess capacity, the burden of this on individualcompanies is far too heavy and no one can be expected tovolunteer, he added. Another possible but very risky solution is to investheavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said. \"My answer to this suggestion is that individual companieswho do not invest will surely die, and those that do investmight survive, but only might, \" Bue said. \"The only real option in my mind is integration,rationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, \" headded. Bue also said that the European smelters were completelydissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates andmetals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basketof the world\'s major currencies or pricing in European currencyunits (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility. Bue\'s views on integration between European smelters weremet by general approval from the conference audience comprisingrepresentatives from many of the world\'s major mining, smeltingand trading companies, although some of the miningrepresentatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their ownindustry\'s move towards integration with smelters. However, some concentrate traders did express worry abouttheir own position if the metals industry does make the move tolarge trading blocs.

{0 'The EC Commission has proposed amodified plan for a tax on marine and vegetable oils and fatsin its revised 1987/88 farm price proposals, an officialdocument detailing the proposals shows. The document, made available to journalists, says thecommission proposes that the tax should start at levelsoriginally proposed for vegetable oils on October 1. However, the tax on marine oils and fats would be cut by 50pct from originally envisaged levels, the document said. In addition, the Commission proposes that the level of thetax, expected to start at 330 Ecus per tonne, could be reviewedevery three months rather than annually. Diplomatic sources said the change to the proposals forfish oils appears to be an attempt to overcome objections tothe tax from Portugal and Spain, major fishing nations. Other countries opposing the tax include Britain, WestGermany and Denmark. The new proposals retain most of the Commission\'s originalplans in other sectors. However, they mark the Commission\'s recognition that itcannot get proposals to reduce the period of intervention forcereals, diplomats said. Instead the Commission proposes to cut the monthlyincrements applied to cereals during the November to May periodwhen intervention is open to 2.7 Ecus a tonne for durum wheatand two Ecus a tonne for other cereals. The document shows the Commission has also changed itsgreen currency proposals in the light of heavy opposition,notably from West Germany. West German and Dutch positive monetary compensatoryamounts (MCAs) would be immediately cut by 0.5 points, with afurther one point cut at the beginning of the 1988/89 season. The Commission originally proposed a complete dismantlingof positive MCAs. For other countries, the Commission makes the followingproposals for dismantling negative MCAs Denmark and Benelux - reduction of around 1.5 points foranimal products and just over two points for crops. France and Ireland - proposals unchanged except for anextra 1.5 point cut for beef. Italy - dismantling of all MCAs except those created sinceJanuary 12.

{0 'European coffee traders and roastersmay propose a new formula for calculating International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meetinghere this week, traders and officials told Reuters. Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of thepossible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, theworld\'s biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for thenext two years and could be a basis for renegotiation. \"The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil\'sattitude, and this compromise could be a solution, \" one said. However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,which began here today and is to continue to the end of theweek, has revealed gaps in the European position onre-introducing quotas. Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was againstre-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally infavour with the single proviso that there had to be someformula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producingcountries. The roasters said the positions were generally fairlyclose, and problems with some Government officials. Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarizedGovernment attitudes, with most other countries on the fence. Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quotare-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour. \"Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by theend of the week to at least present a common European Community(EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of theInternational Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,\" one trader said. \"We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that notonly the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,\"one official said. \"We have learned that we can live without the quotas thatwere suspended in February last year, but would prefer thestability they can bring to the market as long as we do notsimply return to the old and outdated status quo as far asquota allocation is concerned,\" he added. Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on thelikelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildlypessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against. \"Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On theconsumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quotare-introduction, \" he said. \"The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the newBrazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the leastnegotiable position of any of his predecessors,\" one tradersaid. \"However, with many producers starting to swing in favour ofthe consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated undera new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, whichgives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quotameeting in September,\" the official said.

{0 'U.S. House and Senate budgetnegotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reachedyesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spendingon agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters. The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House. The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from thefarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for atotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said. The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculturecommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes inagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targetswithout jeopardizing popular support payments, seniorCongressional aides told Reuters. Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to findthe budget savings. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grainssubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheatand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrsand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs. House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza hassaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal. But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely tobe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers anda strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who saidfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other majorgrain export competitors and would not achieve the budgetsavings Glickman claims. Another area where Glickman and other have said budgetsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,ARP, levels for wheat and corn. However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong standwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 cropwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Mostcommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail. Congressional sources said the only way to achievesignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boostthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source saidsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen asunfair to one commodity. Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is mostlikely to eventually look for budget savings are sometightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains. Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billionbut not enough, they said. Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculturecommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut onall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including pricesupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to theGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.

{0 'Some OPEC states are unhappy about theprices assigned to their crude oil but this should not posegreat problems when the group reviews its six-month-old priceand output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say. They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conferencepresidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievancesabout price differentials making some of their crudesuncompetitive. There has also been speculation by Japanese traders thatOPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices. But most experts agree that a major overhaul of pricedifferentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the marketsignals of a dent in OPEC\'s new unity. \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changingdifferentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"Butat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave wellalone\' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\" Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also sawsales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminishedcustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes bymeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongsidebetter priced grades in a \"package.\" Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at leastfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC shouldchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand forfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. Atits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixedprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel referencepoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarterand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extendor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do notmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlrtarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and onenon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key exportcrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oilexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts sayonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells atofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processingor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,when some producers\' output fell due to customer reluctance topay the new prices. Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude-- now OPEC\'s highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain\'s Brent. In February and March, Nigeria\'s production shrank belowits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output hasrisen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and sayits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel. But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London\'s KleinwortGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push thedifferentials question in Vienna. \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, whichholds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.

Yesterday ARCO\'s stock jumped as much as five points onrumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based onabout 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy wasvaluing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said. Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statementaround mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct ofthe unit, leading investors to take profits. After the announcement, the company\'s stock retreated,closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4. \"It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhatdisappointing,\" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. Hesaid rumors of the spin-off had been around \"for a couple ofdays.\" Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn\'tgetting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and itsvalue was not reflected in the company\'s stock price. Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein saidthe unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year andhe expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year. Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena sayschemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth aboutthree billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500to 600 mln dlrs. Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stakebecause chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated thecompany would use the proceeds to pay down debt. But he added the possibility remained the deal would fallthrough. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet beenpresented to its board.

{0 'A spokesman for the EuropeanCommunity Commission defended the controversial plan for a levyon oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to helpalleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax. Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission\'sDirectorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oilsand Fats Contact Days \"the Commission firmly believes that thesacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers inthe oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers tomake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problemwithin that sector by paying a levy.\" The proposed tax is necessary because the level ofbudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseedsproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said. Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion EuropeanCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community\'s \"standstill\"agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would thenfeel the full impact of its enlargement. The Commission has proposed several cost and productioncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximumguaranteed quantity system, he added. Under the Commission\'s system for stabilising consumerprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghesaid. Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatoryamount when market prices are below or above this level. He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatoryamount would be used to finance the Common AgriculturalPolicy\'s oils and fats regime. \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to theproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incompleteor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said. Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules. It would not be discriminatory because it would be appliedto domestic and imported products, and past experience showedit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats. EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they dounder present aid arrangements, he said. The competitiveness between different oils, whether ECproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantitiesimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,Tanghe said. The proposed system would not alter the EC nations\'requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overalleffect would stabilise Community production levels withoutaffecting demand, he said. It is one of the proposal\'s objectives to maintain currentimport levels, he said. Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they areimported primarily to satisfy the EC\'s cakes and mealsrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from importedbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes. Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.

{0 'The European Community (EC) accused theUnited States of violating a political commitment to free tradethrough practices including a tax on imported gasoline and acustoms user fee. EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to thesurveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters. Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States incriticising Brazil for extending its list of products for whichimport licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as toimprove its balance of payments. The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rulesby restricting imports of agricultural products through animport licensing system. The United States asked forconsultations with Tokyo on the issue. Tran charged that the trade measures contravened apolitical commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September. When ministers established the four year Uruguay round tonegotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATTsurveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATTjargon as \"standstill and rollback.\" Tran criticised Washington for the \"superfund\" tax on oilimports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a specialmachine tool (known as category FSC34) from its governmentprocurement list for reasons of national security. Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended thepolicies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules. The surveillance body will send a record of today\'s talksto the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,to decide any further action on the charges. The oil tax and customs user fee have already been thesubject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside theUruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices. The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel\'sreport and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil importsbreached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify itslegislation.

{0 'Zambia\'s copper mining industry is hopingto achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes ayear in the next few years despite low world prices,deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industryofficials said. But Zambia\'s decision to abandon last May 1 a toughInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program hasintroduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructurethe ailing industry and boost profitability, they said. Copper production by the government-controlled ZambiaConsolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial yearended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from arecord 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes. \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financialyear, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes dueto greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCMofficial said. ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, anotherstrategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand. Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonneshigher than the previous year and the best production achievedto date. Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copperindustry in Zambia, the world\'s fifth biggest producer. Miningis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of thecountry\'s foreign exchange earnings. Production has also been seriously affected in recent yearsby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages ofspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes outputlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes. A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the AfricanDevelopment Bank and the World Bank. The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining andmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable. ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, hassaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce aspart of the plan. More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into theindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability underthe five-year restructuring plan. Company officials said although reserves were beingdepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond theend of the century, though at lower levels of production. Industry sources said ZCCM\'s projected pre-tax profit forthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mlnkwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level beinglevied, a net loss is likely to be registered. ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 comparedwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before. Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in1985, ZCCM\'s profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose asthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just overtwo to the dollar. But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished theauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economicstrategy based on national resources. ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects thebreak with the IMF will have on the industry\'s plans. \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures willaffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fareunder the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operationsand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters. Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchangerate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM\'s exportprofits. \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-evenpoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" FrederickChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said. High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambianindustry. Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United Statesand under 40 cents in Chile. The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambiabeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it hadstopped sBending copper south through South Africa. Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, aresent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares andfuel.

As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report. \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said. Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted. The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before. The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast. This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986. As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986. The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units. \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said. Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. \"However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,\" headded.

{0 'Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gasutility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result ofTransco Energy Co\'s <E> decision to close its pipelines totransport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said. Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in theUnited States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, ornon-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spotsupplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,analysts said. Texas Eastern pipelines <TET>, the other competingpipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the Southclosed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union hasrelied entirely on Transco for spot supplies. In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrsper mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gascosts four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said. Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide openaccess to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fearof accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities. Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers forgas even if delivery is not taken by its customers. Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount ofsupplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, aBrooklyn Union official said. Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidmost of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed throughto rate payers. While net effect on the company will not be known forseveral months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,will end up paying more for gas, he said. Because the closure takes place in summer months when gasdemand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would besmall, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson LufkinJenrette, said. If the situation persists into winter heating season, highcost gas could cut in the company\'s profits, he said. Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco forspot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co <NCNG>,Piedmont Natural Gas Co <PNY>, will face the same high costfactor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager withend users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokeringfirm, said. \"But these companies are not unwitting victims of thetake-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,\" he said. Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco\'s requestfor an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facilityfor spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said. Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas willthreaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting toalternative fuels, he said. In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is beingnegotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said. Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gasfor them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatoryon the inventory charge, he said. \"Cool heads will prevail,\" DLJ\'s Launer said, \" but it maytake a while.\" Reuter',1 NAT-GAS}

{0 'Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon GroupInc <REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for GilletteCo that could draw some big international players and in theprocess make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analystssaid. Several hours before a regularly scheduled board ofdirectors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requestedconsent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs pershare. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed inNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette andmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he standsto make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street todescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwilingtakeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlongets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette throughNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs pershare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain ofthree yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis ofPerelman\'s previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for asplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some othercompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmenreturned telephone calls seeking comment. \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money ifsomeone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj ofMerrill Lynch and Co. \"I\'m not saying that is going to happenbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45dlrs per share.\" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasonswhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiringGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlonprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company twoyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon\'soperations. \"He\'s trying to overhaul and improve the image ofthe dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlonhas recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised ifsome company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and GambleCo <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers forGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>,RJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and RalstonPurina Co <RAL>. \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said aWall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if thecompany is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gilletteto resist Perelman\'s overture. \"I can\'t see the boardconsenting, what has changed between November and now,\" hesaid. Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.\"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount ofcalculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has tobe careful. They just can\'t say no or they\'ll be sued byshareholders.\" Gillette\'s board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time. According to a copy of Perelman\'s letter released byGillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive mergeragreement without any financing condition.

{0 'U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen ifthe two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policyresearch groups. The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Instituteof Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on crossborder trade would benefit both countries. But Cato chairman William Niskanen added \"the two nations\'generally harmonious trade relations are probably notsustainable without a new agreement.\" The United States and Canada, whose cross-border tradetotaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holdingtalks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriersremaining between their two countries. The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but bothsides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargainingremained. Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade tiescould deteriorate because of Congressional pressure onPresident Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, andthis could hit some Canadian trade practices. He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its autoindustry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateralfree trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts. Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable toa resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.exports to Canada. A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada andenable its industries to achieve economies of scale, whichwould also help it widen exports worldwide, he said. It would also increase the gross national products of bothcountries. Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end alltariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rulesfor trade in services and investments, end curbs on governmentprocurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

Turkey\'s economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 anddomestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expectedto be halved to five pct next year.

Both fixed investment and private consumptionwere expected to ease during 1988 but would still remainstrong.
