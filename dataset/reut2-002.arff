{0 'Jaguar Plc <JAGR.L> is about to sell itsnew XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects astrong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman SirJohn Egan told a news conference. Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightlybelow 1985\'s 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an averageprofit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction ofthe new model had kept this year\'s pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans tosell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwardssaid the relatively high car prices in dollars of West Germancompetitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which wouldrestrict the car\'s price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part ofits receipts for longer periods, John Egan said. In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pctof net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for theother half. The firm is in early stages of considering thebuilding of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,but Egan said this would take at least another three years On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar\'s shares were lastquoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday\'s close, afterreporting 1986 results which were in line with marketexpectations, dealers said.

{0 'Responsibility for the appreciation ofthe Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley withthose countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is inthose countries\' own long-term interest to raise the value oftheir currencies against the dollar. Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies againstthe dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficitswith Taiwain and Korea. \"An undervalued currency will help those countries\' exportsin the short term, but in the long run they have to beconcerned about how they are perceived in the internationalbusiness community,\" Yeutter said. For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita tradesurplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan\'s, andwith huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defendthe high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in thatcountry.

{0 'Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS> earningsfor 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult marketconditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due todifferent accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said. The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,while the additional effect of currency movements reduced thecontribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg. The group earlier reported a drop in net income for theyear to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, withlower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales byvolume. Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless atthe top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and TradingPlc <SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stgfrom a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that ageneral collapse in exploration and production volumes waspartially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mlnstg from 205 mln in 1985. Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expectedcurrency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarterresults, which was the main reason for the figures exceedingforecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de ZoeteWedd noted. However, he added there could well be a sharp fall inperformance in the first quarter of 1987, due to theimprobability that the group would be able to repeat the highrefining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986. The impact of recovering oil prices would come throughfaster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such ahigh proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, whichtypically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-yearlag, analysts said. Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the thirdquarter of 1986 had been the worst of all. Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit inthe period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease inU.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the grouphad increased share to become volume market leader, Holmesadded. Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdueU.S. Exploration activity. \"Exploration is currently prettyflat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be nomassive upturn,\" he said. A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the NorthSea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel. Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. \"Ifyou are not exploring you are not going to find anything,\" henoted. U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayedbelow 20 dlrs a barrel.

{0 'Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain\'sdecision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savingsbanks, saying it reflected the socialist government\'sdetermination not to ease up in the fight against inflationdespite the painful social effects of four years of austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by onepercentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excessliquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by theBank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates tochoke off money supply growth. \"I think it\'s a good measure,\" a senior foreign banker said.\"It\'s a faster way to get the job done than using interest ratesand avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.\" \"It shows that the political will is very strong. They knowthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitiveand bring down unemployment in the long run,\" he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a monthago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a risein reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy ofraising interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting moneyfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanishexports less competitive. The government says industry\'s competitiveness is alsobeing hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate wasway above that of Spain\'s major trading partners in theEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year\'s target of five pct, it isinsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage forclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enoughsacrifices. Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whosedemands essentially involve more government spending, havebecome an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister FelipeGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could havesome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit themoney market too hard. The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its keyovernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged attoday\'s auction. The rate has been increased nine times sincethe start of the year, when it was below 12 pct. Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise inany case with the end of the six pct maximium interest ratebanks can offer for time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect tomorrow, following thepublication of the decree in today\'s official gazette. Bankerssay the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,inevitably, push lending rates higher. A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds whichbanks must invest in specific areas, also takes effecttomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last monththat it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higherinterest rates. REUTER',1 INTEREST}

It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreigncurrency that preceded the January 11 realignment of theEuropean Monetary System (EMS). Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francsduring the month, the ministry said. This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs throughoperations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting fromthe quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits heldwith the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM). But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion francdeficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as aresult of using very short-term financing instruments. The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank andother central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchangemarkets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, inan attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flightof funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up thefranc. On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct againstthe French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency. The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reservesto 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74billion at end December. Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.

He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider itsexport plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which ithad proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken asthe country\'s export target to ICO-member countries. The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption anagreement would bring stability to world markets, he added. It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack ofan agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could beabove or below 15.5 mln bags, he said. Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters andmarket analysts before taking any decision on export policy,but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to marketconditions. \"We will not take any short-term decisions which might causemarkets to panic,\" Dauster added. He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffeeto sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement. \"Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it doesnot need an ICO agreement as a crutch,\" Dauster said. Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster saidconsumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to twomln bags in Brazil\'s export quotas. \"It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial lossfor Brazil and which would be difficult for the country torecover,\" he said. The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year movingaverage of exportable production surpluses would lead tooverproduction as countries boosted output to win higherquotas, he said. Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil\'s inflexibilityhad been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that itsstance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries. Close links would continue with these producers,particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone Africancountries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action wasenvisaged at present. He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to asystem of roaster buying contracts, although \"no hypothesis hasbeen abandoned.\" Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations forMay shipment coffee will be opened. He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policyof opening registrations for up to six months in advance, assome exporters had suggested. He noted export registrations for the first four months ofthe year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.

Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Controltracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that isresistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link theresulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promotethe growth of cattle. Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply ofantibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics havebeen warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugsis helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs. Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseasesthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affecthumans. But the new study, reported in Thursday\'s New EnglandJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans. The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the numberof people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistantinfection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half thevictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalizedfor their illness. They also discovered that cooking the meat didn\'t alwaysprevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eatingraw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, \"themajority of cases appear to have been caused by eatinghamburger that was at least partially cooked.\" The researchers said the results show that \"food animals area major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infectionsin humans, and that these infections are associated with(antibiotic) use on farms.\" Reuter',1 LIVESTOCK}

{0 'Leaks of a major Dutch officialeconomic forecast due to be published on Monday indicatereduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment thisyear, political and market sources say. Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitivenessthis year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wageincrease, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered somecalls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth. But whatever the government\'s response, the central bankwill stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say. The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which willalso see a key parliamentary debate on government finances andthe economy. Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimatereflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutcheconomic growth was now seen around one pct. Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset thedecline in export growth caused by slowing growth in WestGermany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,Pierson said in its February economic outlook. The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pctgrowth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September. The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and thegovernment has already admitted it will not meet its goal ofreducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990. Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned centralbank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and ifnecessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder. Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticisedthe guilder\'s revaluation in line with the West German mark inlast January\'s European Monetary System (EMS) realignment andexpressed concern over its effect on competitiveness. But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economyhad become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of thedollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment. Some analysts also question the central bank\'s decision notto copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and insteadlower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge. Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the movesaying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact onthe money market, noting \"the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at themoment not the most important Dutch rate because it is alreadyfar below the market rates.\" Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade ofthe Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interestrate policies serve that goal. Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlandsrecently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being soldto take profits. Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark wouldreduce international confidence in the guilder and make it moredificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutchinterest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revaluedcompletely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.

{0 'Leaks of a major Dutch officialeconomic forecast due to be published on Monday indicatereduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment thisyear, political and market sources say. Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitivenessthis year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wageincrease, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered somecalls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth. But whatever the government\'s response, the central bankwill stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say. The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which willalso see a key parliamentary debate on government finances andthe economy. Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimatereflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutcheconomic growth was now seen around one pct. Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset thedecline in export growth caused by slowing growth in WestGermany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,Pierson said in its February economic outlook. The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pctgrowth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September. The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and thegovernment has already admitted it will not meet its goal ofreducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990. Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned centralbank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and ifnecessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder. Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticisedthe guilder\'s revaluation in line with the West German mark inlast January\'s European Monetary System (EMS) realignment andexpressed concern over its effect on competitiveness. But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economyhad become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of thedollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment. Some analysts also question the central bank\'s decision notto copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and insteadlower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge. Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the movesaying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact onthe money market, noting \"the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at themoment not the most important Dutch rate because it is alreadyfar below the market rates.\" Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade ofthe Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interestrate policies serve that goal. Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlandsrecently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being soldto take profits. Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark wouldreduce international confidence in the guilder and make it moredificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutchinterest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revaluedcompletely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment. Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decisionnot to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Piersonwarned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.

However, the bank said it will maintain the high level ofprovisioning for loan losses established last year because ofmany market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan lossprovisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31. The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.

Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net incomewas partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,non-interest expenses and income taxes. The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainlyto continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.

{0 'The Bank of England again fought againstmoney and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest ratecut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further risein its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pctof its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continuedto buy into a currency which offers high relative returns andthe possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank canstop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should wantto. The Bank\'s latest strong signal to the market that it wantsrates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, whenit lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct torelieve a money market shortage. \"They\'re really making the discount houses suffer,\" saidStephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.\"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.\" This money market signal was apparently not accompanied byany sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which hadinhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers camestrongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the Londonclose, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60marks, up from 2.8720/50. \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility thatrates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economistat finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in thebase rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to beconvinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-ratingrather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, saidPeter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances ofa Conservative Party victory in any early general election, anddisappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides tohold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setbackfor bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but mostforecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable tooil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to setthe timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainablerate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at leasta proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-termcapital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer betthan the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls andcurrent political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on thetrade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But bythen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank ofEngland,\" he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resistingpressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sourcessaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as morethan just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentiallyharmful news on the trade front, today\'s figures showing thatthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current accountdeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this wouldhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that theywere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearingbanks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bankofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for thisweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-pointcut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

{0 'Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistlersaid its counter proposal to merge with Baker InternationalCorp was still under consideration and that a merger was in thebest interests of both companies. \"Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that isgood for both companies,\" Kistler said of the proposed mergerthat would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field servicecompany. \"We\'re working very hard on this merger.\" Hughes\' board today again adjourned a shareholders meetingto vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal. The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concernabout a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that wouldrequire Baker to sell its drilling bit operations andsubmersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened toterminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the twocompanies first find acceptable buyers for the businessesbefore signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving thecounter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas statecourt to force to Hughes to complete the merger. \"The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that mightbe imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervousabout what the outcome might be,\" Kistler said, in explainingwhy Hughes had made the counter proposal. \"We need additional time to understand why Baker did notaccept our proposal.\" Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker \"was nota factor\" in the board\'s decision to keep its merger proposalon the table. He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit. Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider acompromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific. The Justice Department in January said it would block theHughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless bothcompanies agreed to sign a consent decree that would providefor the sale of the assets after the merger took place. The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree becauseits was too \"unreasonable.\" Hughes said that Baker shouldinstead complete the sale of the disputed assets before themerger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptablebuyers within a specified period of time after the decree isapproved, a federal trustee would become responsible forfinding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could takeup to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies mightbe required by the government\'s conditions to license some ofits technology to any purchaser of the assets. Baker said last night in a statement that the requiredassets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,representing about three pct of the revenues of the combinedcompanies.

SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is theleading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland. Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the shareoffer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by FinanceMinister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs. Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised laterthis year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in thebank, Chairman Marc Vienot said. SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidatedgroup profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160mln this year and 159 mln in 1985. SOGENAL\'s privatisation will be preceded by a capitalincrease to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mlnfrancs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal. The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, inline with the Finance Ministry and government\'s aim of aregional operation, Geronimus said. He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Tenpct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employeeswith the rest offered to the public. There will not be a sharereserved for foreign investors. \"This is too small an operationand anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,\" he said. Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs. Geronimus said the bank\'s future aim would be to reinforceits existing strong points, with no major projects plannedapart from the opening soon of a Basle branch. SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up thefirst foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at itsStrasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreignbanking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.

{0 'U.S. retailers posted stronger thanexpected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analyststo change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for thefirst half of 1987. \"My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of thebusiness we normally see later in the quarter and the realstrength of general merchandise sales will be in the secondhalf of 1987,\" said Bear Stearns and Co analyst MonroeGreenstein. \"I don\'t think March will be as strong because Easter fallsin April this year,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb. Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter\'s occurrence. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a3.6 pct increase last year. Analysts noted that February is considered a small,transitory month between winter and spring. In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by anespecially soft February last year which was adversely affectedby severe weather. Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,according to retailers and analysts. \"February\'s strong sales reflected a lot of freshmerchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due totax reductions,\" said Greenstein of Bear Stearns. Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales ofdurable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuinghigh levels of consumer debt. May Department Stores Co <MAY> and K Mart Corp <KM> wereamong the strong performers, posting comparable store salesgains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overallsales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain last month. \"Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programscontinued to positively impact our sales comparisons. INaddition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all ourspecialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,\"said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.

Penney chairman William Howell said, \"store sales werestrongest during the early part of the month, while catalogdemand was consistently strong throughout the period.

{0 'Striking Brazilian seamen, who saythey have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports,today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour MinisterAlmir Pazzianotto, union officials said. Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the NationalMerchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talkswould lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday. Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct. The union official said the strike had halted a total of158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil\'s main port, Santos, andabout 50 more in Rio de Janeiro. Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain,Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said. Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern tothe government, which has already had to suspend interestpayments on part of Brazil\'s foreign debt following a drasticdeterioration in the country\'s trade balance. The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, MuriloRubens Habbema, was quoted in today\'s Gazeta Mercantilnewspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign shipscould be authorized to transport Brazilian exports. \"Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it isnot conceivable that exports be hit,\" he said. \"But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we aregoing to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad,and all this through the fault of the seamen,\" Rubens Habbemasaid. A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been thescene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, saidmovement of ships out of the port was running at about half itsnormal level of 12 ships a day. He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchoron moored in the harbour. Reuter',1 SHIP}

{0 'The highly visible drama involving theyen\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the factthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against majorEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange ratedistortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statementsby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters thecurrency movements of the past two years are also creating afundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up newtrade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments arealready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare internationalcooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact betweenthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut downthe value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the majorcurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in whichthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but notnecessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement tookplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreementsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert inTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. \"You have to look at the dollar\'s peak compared with now,and that was well before Plaza,\" he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention andperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, thedollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical crossrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. TheEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and tradeflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, butundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three ischanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the ECboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half ofof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exportsand 21 pct for imports in yen terms. \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have atremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unitsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is importantto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that islaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable yearin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to itsstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive thanU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rateimbalance, and which will cause problems. \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC isreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. Buttherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitiveedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First InternationalEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you wantmy objective view, I don\'t expect a drastic improvement in ourtrade imbalance.

He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington toimpose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domesticsupport programs. This covered imports of dairy products,peanuts, cotton and sugar. Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to theGATT, told Reuters: \"These charges have been made since the verybeginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agriculturalpolicy, part of our law when we joined the GATT\". \"We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during theUruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same withtheir programs. We can negotiate them all,\" Samuels added. Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguayround of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking,tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well asmanufactured goods.

The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winterwheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting andstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. The administration has strongly urged that the bill beexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year. It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provisionwill emerge from the committee, the sources said. Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are largeestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimatesby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs. Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at thistime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion ofthe bill, committee staffers said. The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. Aconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, andstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.

An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in lastweek\'s subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommitteechairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of theconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings wasnecessary. Major commodity groups, including the National CornGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen\'sAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.

{0 'Carl Icahn\'s bold takeover bid forUSAir Group <U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,which was being courted by USAir. Yesterday, Icahn\'s Transworld Airlines Inc <TWA> made a 1.4billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAirtakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close toaccepting the bid. Today, USAir rejected Icahn\'s 52 dlr per share offer andsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in itstakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA wasoff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spreadit would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attemptto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract asuitor who might want both airlines once they merged. \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer orPiedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager. Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the currentprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir\'s bid willsucceed. Piedmont\'s largest shareholder and other suitor, NorfolkSouthern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for thecompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half ofPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance. Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price ofPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline isdestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is theleast likely to be bought. Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation inthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of athree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn\'soffer, which lacked financing and was riddled withcontingencies. Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of twoairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA. \"You can\'t discount him,\" said one arbitrager. Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he isserious by following through with his threats or making a newoffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to godirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lowerprice if USAir rejected his offer. \"It\'s clear Icahn wants to sell and he\'s bluffing,\" saidone arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced byabout six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn\'s proposed three-way airlinecombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, butothers believe it could be cleared if the companies areacquired separately. \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal towork,\" said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly andcomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahnsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA\'s wagescale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, theysaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines\'costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be anecessary ingredient for a merger to work. However, other analysts speculated the managements ofPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a newcompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a wayfor him to exit the company if USAir\'s airline is then mergedinto TWA. Reuter',1 ACQ}

{0 'Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukmansaid the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpdceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had beendelayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opecprices. Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home fromJamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that inFebruary, Opec had underproduced partly because members werestrictly abiding by production quotas and partly because theywere resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to officialprices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. \"We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,\"he said. \"I have spoken to every other Opec minister and theyare committed to making the accord work,\" he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. Hesaid the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing thesefigures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimatedthat Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, hesaid; \"That could well be correct.\" Opec\"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement sayinggroup output was \"well below\" its ceiling in February. But itgave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February outputmay have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had allproduced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which saidit would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the Decemberpact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said. Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" thatin February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mlnallocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by hiscountry were coming under price pressure because they werecurrently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades andthe United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude. However, he said Opec in December had anticipated thatdemand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasonsand expected the market to firm in two to three weeks. \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market isnow firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that heexpected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices afterearly April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demandfor gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuelaand Indonesia were having less problems with output thanproducers like his own country because they exported oilproducts. Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opecpricing system, he said. Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to liftsome Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocksand ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventuallyhave to buy Opec oil. \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)they will realise they should buy now instead of paying morelater on,\" he said. Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was beingpressured by equity producers for better terms, said it wasimportant to know that terms with them were negotiable,flexible and under constant review, not only when the marketseemed weak. He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nationministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and thatsuch a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priorityfor Opec at the moment. \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said.\"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord isworking, not dealing with a differential of cents betweengrades.\" But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections overthe differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.

Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets heredemonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need foran urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade andproduction. \"It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom andharmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) thedisruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls ofprotection climb higher and the level of possible retaliationbecome more harmful,\" U.S. Department of Agriculture DeputyAdministrator William Bailey said. Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, whichends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need toadjust its policies to the changing market environment. The need for urgent reforms is justified by the \"imbalanceand tensions of the world economy,\" the secretary general of theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and DevelopmentJean-Claude Paye said. And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, he noted. Paye stressed the need for a progressive and jointreduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measuresto help farmers in unprofitable areas. Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farmprices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, andinstead help farmers through income support and adjustmentaids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president ofCargill (USA), one of the world\'s largest cereal houses. Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must takegreater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.

{0 'A one billion dlr lawsuit pushedHughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of aproposed merger with Baker International Corp <BKO>, WallStreet analysts said. Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker wasoff. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages fromHughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes saidit was still interested in the merger. The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that itstroubles could make it a takeover candidate. There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallasinvestor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reutershe is not interested. Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securitiesand Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more insome publicly traded company. He declined to identify thetarget other than to rule out Hughes. One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughesturnabout was Borg-Warner Corp <BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct ofHughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on theHughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker. Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in amerger, and Baker\'s response that a merger is still possibile,analysts said no one could be certain where the situation wasgoing. \"I think the merger is not going through,\" said Phil Pace,analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger \"lost alot of its appeal\" when the U.S. Department of Justice requiredthat Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation. Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view ofthe total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said \"30 to 40pct of the cost savings are tied up in that.\" \"They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,\"said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.\"Apparently they are willing to continue discussions butwhether they will alter their position, I don\'t know. \"It\'s getting a little confusing,\" said James Carroll,analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments citedby Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger \"tend to be weak.\"Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger itwanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longerperiod of time. Hughes contended it was better to formally combine thecompanies with the status of Reed already settled. Bakerapparently sees no reason to speed up the sale. Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mlndlrs in savings if the companies were combined without sellingReed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will besaved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.

The companies said the acquisition will result in arestatement of ConAgra\'s earnings for the fiscal year endingMay 31, but the restatement is not expected to materiallychange the previously reported, or upcoming, fiscal year-endearnings. In fiscal 1986, ConAgra had net income of 105.3 mlndlrs on sales of 5.9 billion dlrs. For its fiscal year ending August 1986, Monfort reported25.1 mln dlrs in earnings on sales of 1.6 billion dlrs. Thecompany is one of the largest lamb and beef producers in theU.S., producing, transporting and selling the productsdomestically and internationally. Reuter',1 ACQ}
{0 'Key members of the House Agriculturecommittee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of apending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but abroader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later,Congressional sources said. The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. GlennEnglish (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to supportan amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm(D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 cropwinter and spring wheat. This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the originalproposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987wheat only. That provision was later broadened by thesubcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat. Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but stillcollect 92 pct of deficiency payments. Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponeduntil next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid billand 0/92. The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot programfollows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influentialfarm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill. Congressional sources said there has not been enough timeto study the implications of a broad 0/92. \"The timing (of the proposal) is off,\" said one aide to aHouse Agriculture committee member. However, several Congressional sources said they expect abroader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the HouseAgriculture committee is faced next month with the need to makespending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as partof an overall deficit reduction package. Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture\'s share of budget cuts mayexceed one billion dlrs. A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both theCongressional Budget Office and the Reagan administrationestimate it would result in significant budget savings. A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5billion dlrs over five years. Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is theapproach of planting season, Congressional sources said. Some officials said it already is late for implementationof a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 forwheat and feedgrains. If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up eitherwould have to be extended or reopened, sources said. Reuter',1 GRAIN}

{0 'Brazil\'s recent announcement of asuspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreigndebt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed viewsamong many international economists and commodities analyststhat Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987. The developing world\'s most indebted nation is also itsmost prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such ascoffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchangerevenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said. \"That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is noway they can trade their way out of this situation,\" AldoRoldan, Vice President for International Services at ChaseEconometrics, said. Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle theproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on gluttedworld markets, but also had to work to make its position onforeign exchange markets more profitable. \"Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) andexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchangerates,\" Roldan said. The Chase economist also said commodities markets weredepressed and generally did not appear very promising for acountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23billion dlrs. But he added: \"They are always pretty aggressive and theyhave good foreign marketing channels.\" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will becoffee, and even without background pressure from foreigncreditors the world\'s largest producer was expected to hit themarket this year with a vengeance. Negotiations between International Coffee Organization(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke upearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusingeach other of intransigence. \"Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,which others wanted changed,\" one senior coffee dealer said. The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted topreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he saidBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and otherswould suffer. Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario butas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, thedealer said. \"If they do come into the market at this level it will golower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,\"he said. New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 centslower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distantdeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit. President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Daustertold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil hasno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown ofthe ICO talks on export quotas. Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be thefocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. \"Theywill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\"according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plusdifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of theBrazil soybean crop. \"Brazilian farmers also need cash flow andthey can\'t afford to store the crops,\" he said. The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some timeabout large South American crops developing under near idealconditions towards record yields. \"We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier thanusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,\" Loewy said. Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American SoybeanAssociation (ASA), said this year\'s Brazilian soybean harvestcould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year. Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather. Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said. He said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers canforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay theloan. \"We\'re getting into a period when they (Brazil) arestarting to harvest and starting to export,\" Eshleman said. Buthe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently. Jose Melicias from the research department of DrexelBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation. He said the debt situation was a major consideration. \"TheBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage,\" he added. Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazilwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias saidit would not make a big difference. On other commodity markets, Brazil\'s selling impact may bemuted no matter its need to generate capital. Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, whichcould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. Thecountry may have oversold and be unable to honor exportcommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused byconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, willgive it little room to stretch exports, they said. Brazil\'s other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year ofsurplus. \"Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year itfell, so I don\'t think they can start throwing out cocoa andfind many more markets for it,\" one analyst said. \"If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market wouldcollapse and they can\'t afford to do that,\" she added.

Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be thefocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. \"Theywill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\"according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plusdifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of theBrazil soybean crop. \"Brazilian farmers also need cash flow andthey can\'t afford to store the crops,\" he said. The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some timeabout large South American crops developing under near idealconditions towards record yields. \"We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier thanusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,\" Loewy said. Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American SoybeanAssociation (ASA), said this year\'s Brazilian soybean harvestcould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year. Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when pricesare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to thevulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather. Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of areduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered tofarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said. He said there has been some uncertainty this year about thesoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for pricesby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers canforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay theloan. \"We\'re getting into a period when they (Brazil) arestarting to harvest and starting to export,\" Eshleman said. Buthe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently. Jose Melicias from the research department of DrexelBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as muchas it can this year because of its economic situation. He said the debt situation was a major consideration. \"TheBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay forstorage,\" he added. Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazilwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias saidit would not make a big difference. On other commodity markets, Brazil\'s selling impact may bemuted no matter its need to generate capital. Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, whichcould limit exports to the world market, analysts said.

{0 'Costa Rica\'s economy minister said hesees new hope for winning changes in the International CoffeeOrganisation system of export quotas. Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president ofthe Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful becauseof the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing-nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britainand the Netherlands at last week\'s ICO meeting in london. Escalante told a news conference here he \"carried the weightof the negotiations\" at the meeting by calling for larger exportquotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations. Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quotasystem based on a producing nation\'s real export capacity, onceit has satisfied internal demand. \"There are countries such as our own whose salespossibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their currentquotas,\" Escalante said. At the same time, there are countries favoured by thecurrent system that have been assigned quotas far above theirexport potential, he said. The current ICO quota system is \"unfair and autocratic,\"Escalante said. Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffeeprices over the last week to speculation rather than realmatters of supply and demand. \"Be careful,\" he warned, \"there\'s not as much coffee in theworld as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust.\" Reuter',1 COFFEE}
{0 'U.S. money supply growth is slowingdown rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of theFederal Reserve\'s main monetary aggregates may even havecontracted in February. A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for theFed, especially as it would follow a long period of torridgrowth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in theweeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policywas justified on account of weakness in the economy. M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reportedtoday, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminaryforecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs. M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.With other components of M-2, such as money-market depositaccounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage isset for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say. M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditionallink to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact offalling interest rates and banking deregulation. But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates islikely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill LynchEconomics Inc. \"The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they\'re allsending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrowsat the Fed,\" McCarthy said. Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, \"Wehave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It\'scoming in a lot weaker than I thought.\" The economists were quick to caution that one month\'s dataprove nothing, especially because money growth previously hadbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pctrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks. Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably beexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into thebooming stock market and is thus not an indication of aslowdown in the business expansion. But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bondmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly areflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus. McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides withsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarterprogresses. \"Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy asthey were a month ago,\" he noted. He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March andrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct. Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pctor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderateenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross nationalproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. \"You\'dcertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\" There was certainly nothing in the Fed\'s latest balancesheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already underway, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in linewith expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Incargued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much tosolve America\'s most urgent economic problem, its massive tradedeficit. Because of the possibility that further dollardepreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed toclose the trade gap, Brusca said \"I\'m not prepared to be allthat optimistic about the bond market.\" Reuter',1 MONEY-SUPPLY}

{0 'Momentum in th U.S. economy may bepicking up given solid across-the board increases in theFebruary U.S. employment report, economists said. U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previouslyreported 448,000 increase. \"Even if you look at January and February together, this isstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation inthe market,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal muchlarger gains in February U.S. production and income thanpreviously forecast. The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week sinceNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said. \"The gains in manufacturing employment point to a verylarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7pct,\" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4pct gain in January U.S. industrial production. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Incnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hourin February from 8.83 dlrs in January. \"Combined with the increase in hours worked, this meanswe\'ll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-visthe wage and salary disbursement,\" he said. Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income shouldrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January. He said the February employment gains are consistent withhis firm\'s first quarter U.S. real gross national productgrowth forecast of 3.7 pct. Economists agreed that the employment data were negativefor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economyand no easing in the Federal Reserve\'s monetary policy. Butmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either. \"This report is another reason for the Fed to not considereasing,\" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,\" hesaid. \"If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,but it\'s most likely they\'ll sit and wait.\" \"The data have not been uniform,\" Stone added. \"Durablegoods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\" In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gapwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs. \"Things just aren\'t adding up,\" said Steve Slifer of LehmanGoverment Securities Inc. \"Consumer spending, capital spending,goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak firstquarter GNP growth of one pct,\" he said. \"The employment and production data point to a biginventory build-up, but that\'s what we thought in the fourthquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\" Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain wasaccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machineryindustries returning to work.

The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse\'sunofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid forthe shares although it expected to buy them back itself. The statement said the sale did not represent anywithdrawal from Nordbanken\'s undertakings towards the Fermentagroup and that it had been sanctioned by the other mainshareholders. Nordbanken is Fermenta\'s third largest creditor with loansof 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks whichlast month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solveits immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other mainshareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mlncrowns until a new equity issue could be made. Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders\'meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue. Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crownloan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results. Fermenta\'s new management originally hoped to raise 160 mlncrowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor andshareholder <Gotabanken> and the group\'s new majority owner<Industrivarden AB>. The share price was to be 20 crowns.

But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson\'s policy, stated at the end of the ParisGroup of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterlingbroadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sourcessaid. Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closingtrade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after theParis meeting and up 0.4 on the day. Today\'s peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19. A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanteda substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question istherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting. Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch EuropeLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see thetrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this actionover the last few weeks, sterling\'s only just within strikingdistance of that range,\" he said. Other analysts agree that the government probably has somebroad target range around this area. However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see thepound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk ofa loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports. \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as theyare, what\'s to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executivedirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the Londonforeign exchange market. Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been activeselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack ofgeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helpedkeep it below 1.60 dlrs. The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting. But Cox says the government must be worried with sterlingheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if itholds around these levels. He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interestrate boat. \"If rates don\'t come down, the market will say theyought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said. Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" beinginvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnightor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally shortnotice. However, the authorities will hope that at least aproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment. \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) andhave to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey,economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued support forsterling, at least in the near term. However, most analysts are still looking for a full pointabout March 17, Budget Day. The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to theBudget, said Temperton. The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in therun-up to a general election, the major factor behind currentbullishness in the government bond and currency markets. \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest ratecut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, theequities arm of Mercury International Group. Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead theway lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall inthe weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct lastFriday might mean the Bank had changed its mind. This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 113/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowestsince base rates were at 10 pct, early last October. However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-monthsmoney, banking sources said the market could not take the cutas a guide to the Bank\'s intentions on short term rates. REUTER',1 INTEREST}

{0 'Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. <ABNN.AS>chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank\'s 10.3 pct increasein net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 wasencouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar. Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the releaseof ABN\'s 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreignearnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank\'s stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN\'s shareprice on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely thefuture trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates andABN\'s share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1pct to 242 mln guilders, he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earningsmargins via traditional lending activities, he said. Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing riskprovisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overlyconcerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factorwhich brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bankstocks recently. He said that of the bank\'s estimated 25 financiallytroubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were LatinAmerican countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said. He added that losses incurred through loans to tinproducers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 hadbeen written off. REUTER',1 EARN}

{0 'U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the pricecould rise another dollar as inventories fall. \"OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash marketthere is tight supply of crude with short transportation timeto major refining centers,\" said Daniel McKinley, oil analystwith Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. \"That could send prices50 cts to a dollar higher,\" he added. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week. The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell inFebruary more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs abarrel. \"Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption thatoil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have comeunder question,\" McKinley said. Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthlyreport said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or inindustrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd duringthe first quarter of this year. IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the firstquarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whoseinventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mlntonnes, or about 74 days consumption. Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpddraw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterdayfed speculation that other major companies were destocking. Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of aso-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buyingofficially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organizationto offer discounts to the official price. \"This struggle between the companies and OPEC is theultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relativelysoon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\"the general trading manager of an international oil companytold Reuters in a telephone interview. For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cuttingexcess supplies from the market by a reduction of its ownoutput, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output tobe 14.7 mln bpd this week. Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspendoil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments. \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expectingit to be there,\" McKinley said. International oil traders said that other short-haulcrudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asianrefiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readilyavailable Mideast crudes earlier this week. If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid upthe price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, tradingmanagers at several companies told Reuters. But there were skeptics who said they wondered how longOPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues. Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg CommodityManagement, said OPEC production was lower \"because of theSaudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if itgives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\" He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for othermembers who produce over their quota, and the drain on theSaudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as lowas 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added. There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in thespot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said. Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for deliveryinto the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, whichtraded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light. Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the FarEast at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price. \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-governmentdeals, which are below official prices and this is probablybeing resold,\" one international trader said.

Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for thecompany to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set forDecember 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their viewsconcerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the votingpower of substantial Lucky stockholders. Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores\' stock,last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company. Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuringprogram that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its owncommon shares and reincorporation in Delaware.

{0 'American Telephone and Telegraph Co\'sproposal to deregulate its long distance phone service isunlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but itshould help the company\'s profits, analysts said. \"Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for largevolume users, but status quo for residential users,\" saidPaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman. But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that hasconstrained the company\'s profits in the long distancebusiness, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said. ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distancebusiness, the profits of which have been limited by a regulatedrate-of-return on the company\'s investments. The rate was cutlast year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct. Earlier today the company proposed to the FederalCommunications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amountof time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up toits competitors to oppose it filings. MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> made a similar filingyesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competitionin the telephone business. Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs inthe long-distance unit, and increase its profit marginspreviously constrained by the rate of return. But many saidthey did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices inthe industry, simply because of the competition the phoneindustry giant faces. \"You probably wouldn\'t see as much of a price decline,\"said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. \"But you wouldn\'tsee a rise.\" Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT toselectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. \"Itwill give ATT a lot more flexibility,\" he said. ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number ofcompanies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCChearings. It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, thelong distance joint venture between GTE Corp <GTE> and UnitedTelecommunications Inc <UT>. \"We think the Congress of the FCC should establish areasonable rate of return.

Dome earlier said it was not considering selling EncorEnergy, but reaffirmed the company\'s 23.3 pct interest inCanadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd <DM> is up for sale \"atthe right price.\" Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment thatit does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. TheEncor shares do not pay dividends. A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when askedwhether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake. At current market prices, Dome\'s stake in Encor would bevalued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Minesshares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs. Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may alsoprompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in theCanadian oil and gas producer, analysts said. \"Encor\'s stock price has improved quite substantially inrecent weeks with a runup in crude prices,\" Peters and Co Ltdoil analyst Wilf Gobert commented. \"The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see itsold at these levels because they can get more for it now thanthey have been able to in recent years,\" he added. Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around sixdlrs in early February. The company also recently set up its own operatingmanagement, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented. Dome and Encor \"are actually going to get farther apart. So(the sale) does make a lot of sense,\" Mote said. However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divestEncor in favor of retaining the operating assets since saleproceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome\'s debt toCommerce Bank. \"I think they\'ll probably try to hang onto Encor as long asthey can,\" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber. Some of Dome\'s group of 56 major creditors might move toblock such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets. \"Other creditors generally all want to make sure thatsomething they might be able to get a piece of is not beingsold out from under them,\" said analyst Gobert. Another stumbling block would be Encor\'s 225 mln dlr jointliability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by ArcticPetroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration. Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder thepossible sale of Dome Petroleum\'s interest in Dome Mines. Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum\'sdebt and has a \"right of consent\" to the sale of Dome Petroleum\'sholding. Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shareswould seek some type of relief on the company\'s debtobligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said. Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at whatprice the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share \"are veryattractive.\" Reuter',1 ACQ}

The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employmentduring February was above market expectations for a rise of170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bondfutures that drove the June contract through key technicalsupport at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted. \"I don\'t like that fact that we had a close below 101,\"said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 levelin the June bond contract had been the top of a three-monthtrading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesdayled to bullish forecasts by chartists. But analysts called it a false breakout on the weeklycharts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday. Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32may signal a bearish double top formation portending steeplosses. \"I tend to go along with the double top scenario,\" saidNorthern Futures analyst Eileen Rico. Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the factthat the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures hasoccurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals. Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leinerremains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should findsupport between 100 and 99-16/32 next week. The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner\'s expectationthat the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based onan improving inflation outlook. With the dollar stable and economic data giving the FederalReserve little room to ease monetary policy, \"the inflationoutlook is improving,\" Leiner said, and that should lead torelatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollarprices. Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil pricesremains a concern for the inflation outlook.

{0 'Senior officials in the West Germancoalition government said tax cuts planned for next year wouldbe increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge madeby Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month\'sinternational monetary conference in Paris. Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian SocialUnion Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference alsoattended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union andFree Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billionmark reduction would represent net tax relief. An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned. The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cutsalready planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks. Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax reliefwould be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginalincrease in income tax. An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whosechildren are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from thetax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for byincreasing the level of special depreciations for small- andmedium-sized companies. The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part ofa general reform of the tax system which will come into effectin 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of thisreform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, wouldbe introduced next year, ahead of schedule. The West German government had come under pressure from theUnited States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. ButStoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, whilethe economy would continue to expand this year, the rate ofgrowth was uncertain. The government said in January it was aiming for realgrowth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but someeconomists have revised their predictions down to two or below. Stoltenberg said: \"We remain on a course of expansion.Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer tothree pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a fewdays ago, remains open at the moment.\" REUTER',1 GNP}

{0 'As a British government investigation gotunder way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of FreeEnterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts hadalready been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminaryinvestigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferrycapsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred toleave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decksthrough the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, TownsendThoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to theHerald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not plannedto pull them out of service at present. \"Our investigator is there already. We shall have to waitand see. But it is too early to say what happened,\" he told BBCradio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submergedhulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubtshad already been expressed about the design of so-called \"RoRo\"ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International MaritimeConsultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-onroll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deckareas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West Germanyard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safetystandards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers wouldhave had problems getting off this type of ship because of itsdesign. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langleysaid the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects toa barge. \"As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches outof line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship iscompartmentalised and you have more stability,\" he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectlystable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level. \"If you do get water into that area then you can get verysevere effects on the stability of the ship,\" he added.

{0 'The suspension of Ecuador\'s crude oilshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last atleast four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports afterrepairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which linksjungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to thepipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oilaccounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisationof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumpingabout 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpdabove the output quota assigned by the cartel, another EnergyMinistry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombianpipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could takeabout 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the endof January, about equal to one month\'s imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billiondlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country\'stotal foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest inLatin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela wouldloan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next threemonths to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic suppliesand would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela inrepayment in May, Lusinchi said.

{0 'Increased federal government borrowingneeds and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buymark assets could push yields in German public authority bondshigher this year, bond market sources say. \"At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-termrates. But how rates move in the long end will depend stronglyon foreigners,\" one portfolio manager for a large securitiesinvestment house in Frankfurt said. The sources also said the government had already stepped upits borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs. Friday\'s loan stock was the third this year already, thesources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of sixpct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue. This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pctcoupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct. But dealers said the terms were not enough to attractforeign investors, and the federal government would have topush yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon. Sources noted federal government issues had also increasedin size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volumeonly starting last May. One finance ministry economist said \"It isn\'t more. It\'sjust the size (of each bond) which has increased.\" He addedconditions in the capital market currently remained fairlyfavourable for raising new debt. Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors. With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, ashopes of further currency gains in marks diminish. Sources said the government has may have already stepped upits borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks. The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowingthrough bonds was 26.6 billion. The sources said this indicated a move by the governmentout of other types of debt to gain access to foreign fundsthrough the more acceptable loan stock form. Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a largeamount of issues maturing recently, other factors, includingthe government\'s tax reduction program, would also reduceincome next year. \"The problem here will be the tax reform,\" theportfolio manager said. He added that the government\'s cut in its top income taxrate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult forthe government to reduce borrowings. The sources said the government would fall far short ofcovering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from thetax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced tofall back on debt markets in one form or the other. The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federalgovernment loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallenback twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through theissue of fixed-rate medium-term \"Kassenobligation\" notes. A finance ministry economist said the government did notexpect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only anet 22.3 billion marks this year. Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend wouldprobably not continue next year as the further tax cuts comeinto effect. \"I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform wouldmean government borrowing will increase,\" the manager said. Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, withthe Bundesbank\'s public authority bond yield calculationfalling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier. But sources said foreign demand for the new federalgovernment loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that thedollar may now rise against the mark. \"The demand wasn\'t so good,\" a dealer for a German bank inLondon said. The dollar\'s recent slight appreciation against the markeven meant that foreign investors have sold mark bondsrecently, some dealers said. REUTER',1 INTEREST}
