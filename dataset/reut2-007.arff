{0 'Media group John Fairfax Ltd <FFXA.S>said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected theimpact of changes in the Australian tax system. Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mlna year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30mln from 44.29 mln. Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase incompany tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax onfringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, thecompany said in a statement. Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenuegrowth in the television industry as another reason for theflat first half earnings. It said it considered the result satisfactory in view ofthese factors. Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney MorningHerald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, asdid the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremelysatisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly. But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0pct rise in revenue, it said. Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to netearnings because group borrowings were reduced following thereceipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from <AustralianAssociated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP\'s \"B\"shares in Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L>. This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit. Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for thefull year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlracquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbournewill hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens inSydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

{0 'The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to furtherslash output in the second quarter in an effort to save itssemiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said. The United States has accused Japan of reneging on thesemiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-priceJapanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened totake retaliatory action after April 1. The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop sellingcut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports ofAmerican chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus. MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has beenpressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that willboost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export. Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers toreduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeksof the first quarter. If that reduced production level were maintained through tothe end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pctbelow that of the first three months of the year. MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said theministry has not yet decided on the extent of the secondquarter cutback. One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground inAsia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets thereare picking up. MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanesesemiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attemptsto ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact. REUTER',1 TRADE}

Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg,and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg.

Their comments followed remarks by prime minister JacquesChirac\'s spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministerswere agreed on the desirability of \"relaunching\" the economy. This sparked speculation the government was preparing for areflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruledout any such move. The sources today said the government\'s policy remained oneof \"recovery,\" or sound finances and greater efficiency. They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion francrevenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisationprogram will go to providing public companies with freshcapital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go towardpaying off national debt. Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30billion would be distributed between repayment of nationalinternal debt and public companies in similar proportions, theyadded. The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation whenthe country\'s internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct thisyear from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice asfast as gross domestic product.

It has risen about two cents this week alone. \"Another factor is that banks in London, where the mainmarket is based, are going long in the currency because of ageneral feeling that it will rise in the future,\" one economistsaid. Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier thatwas expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidationphase from recent gains. After reaching 30 cents, \"There is a chance of appreciationto 32 cents in the next several weeks,\" one dealer said. There was a widespread feeling that both the commercialrand, holding stable at 48 cents, and the financial rand werestaying firm, banking sources said. A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to beidentified said: \"The rise of the independents appears to beindicative of a potential shift of power in the National Partyand has created a favourable sentiment overseas.\" One dealer said growing business and investor interest fromWest Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand\'srise. Economists said foreigners also were being attracted bySouth Africa\'s long-term government bonds and \"semi-gilts\" orsecurities in partly government-owned firms, many with yieldsas high as 30 pct. They could be purchased with financial randswith interest paid in commercial rands. \"This has had a definite influence on the financial form ofthe rand,\" a dealer said, adding that at present demand isslightly in excess of supply. The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 tohelp end capital flight from South Africa during a period ofsevere political unrest in the country. REUTER',1 RAND}

President Robert Staubli told a news conference that thefirst two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit wouldat least equal last year\'s figure, but said much depended onoutside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss onSwissair\'s core flying business last year, against a profit of27 mln francs the previous year, he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francsin 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended onthe speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s. Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation. Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mlnfrancs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions madethis time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange ratefluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop inthe dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuelprices, there was no such offset for the strength of the francagainst other European currencies. \"Income and profit generated by services to these countriesshrank by a very substantial margin,\" he said. \"Exchange ratetrends therefore hit us much more severely than most otherairlines.\" Reuter',1 EARN}

Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of thenegotiations \"optimistic and realistic.\" The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules whena new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January,with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussionson the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority atthis semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide inworld cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principlesas a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs.

The draft proposal included three principles: a limit tonon- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer systemfor buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to bepaid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegatessaid.

{0 'A new market has emerged in warrants tobuy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the playof commodity options into the field of securities. Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American bankshave launched a total of four issues of warrants with varyingconditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and therecovery of the gold price last year. And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston eachissued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have asimilar character, though they are aimed at a less professionalmarket. The market is still small. Taken together, the fourAmerican-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swissfrancs. But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors andpredicted a lively future. Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AGsaid: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have along-term investment in gold with limited risk.\" Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants onFebruary 27, following it up with a second issue less than aweek later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA. The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurichorganized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of BanqueIndosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty(Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co ofNew York. The four issues now offer investors striking prices forgold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, thesame price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level onthe first one for Citibank. The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturitiesfrom 18 months to four years and three months, in all caseslonger than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets. The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back tothe February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when ajump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation. \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said MatsJoensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and theUnited States has grown very strongly in the last year andpeople want to take a ride on gold.\" The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, haslanguished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past fewweeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a morehighly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited. Barrett said it was natural that the market developed inSwitzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understandwarrants,\" he said. Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series ofequity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company sharesover the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launchedcovered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to giveforeign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closedto all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage. But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried upwhen Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks. The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simplepremiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to providescientific comparisons between titles in the options market. Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank\'s issue wascompetitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, forfive ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, makinga premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct. Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue\'slong, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicitvolatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,which he claimed was lower than the other issues. But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp usedpointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue andemphasized that the models were at best an inexact science. And each bank, using its own model, put the implicitvolatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct. Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warmwelcome from investors. Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrantsapiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn\'t buy these becausethe premiums are too high,\" he said.

The increase followed a revised 0.2 pct rise in personalincome during January. Earlier, the department estimatedJanuary personal income was unchanged. The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increasesince a 1.2 pct rise in April 1986, the department said. Itattributed last month\'s rise to several factors, includingsubsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises. The department said personal consumption expenditures wereup during February by 1.7 pct or 49.1 billion dlrs to 2,855.9billion dlrs after falling by 58.4 billion dlrs or two pct inJanuary. Purchases of durable goods were up 24.8 billion dlrs lastmonth after decreasing by 69.7 billion dlrs in January withsales of motor vehicles accounting for most of the Februaryincrease and the January decline, the department said. Purchases of nondurables rose 10.7 billion dlrs in Februaryafter a 300 mln dlr increase in January. The Commerce Department said wage and salary incomes wereup 15.6 billion dlrs in February after an 8.6 billion dlr risein January.

Farmers\' incomes increased by 12.2 billion dlrs in Februaryafter declining by 8.7 billion dlrs in January. Both lastmonth\'s increase and January\'s fall in farm incomes was becauseof government subsidy payments, the department said. Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5.5 billion dlrs inFebruary following a 19.5 billion dlrs January drop. The declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from amonth earlier but that was offset by declines in federalnonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes. Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up1.2 pct or 37.8 billion dlrs to 3,063.4 billion dlrs afterrising 25.8 billion dlrs in January.

{0 'The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan andKorea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic andcurrency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries,economists said. \"The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will bescreaming at those countries about their exports,\" said SteveCerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoricagainst Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow theircurrencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrializedcountries (NICs) amid signs the dollar\'s steep drop against thecurrencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the mainfocus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning toclose the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that heexpects a reduction in Japan\'s trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on theirown doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have notrisen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiariesof soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese andKorean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington wasJapan-bashing. Now it\'s NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, ofLloyds Bank PLC. Asia\'s four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singaporeand Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral tradedeficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend iscontinuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. Thegap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps todefuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing manyof the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut importtariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said lastweek that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three tofive years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cuttariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 andtry to diversify exports. But vice economic minister WangChien-Shien said last month that he still does not expectTaiwan\'s trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textilesand electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in thearea of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America-- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. \"The NICs\' exports are almost all manufactured goods. Whentheir exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturingbase. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said BobWendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea\'s computer products exports,72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of itstelecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan andSouth Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with theU.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand inmarked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly intolarge bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall tradeand current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan\'s overall trade surplus to grow to18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, andKorea\'s to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan\'s exports to the U.S. have beenat Japan\'s expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February\'s Paris meeting of six major industrial powersexorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little responsefrom the two nations so far and, in any case, will only workwith a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan\'s andKorea\'s currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which ispegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct sinceSeptember 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat againstthe U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. \"We\'ve not seen any lessening of competition from thosecountries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" saidBethlehem Steel\'s Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use theirhefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism willget given the administration\'s free-trade stance. \"It\'s hard tosee that anything will be passed much before year-end. And thenthe question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said. Reuter',1 TRADE}

{0 'Madagascar\'s available coffeeoutput is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agriculturalservices and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas,Agriculture Ministry sources said. This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside,they said. The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987,but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes lastyear from 41,662 in 1985. Low yields from the country\'s ageing coffee plantations andprevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix alsocontributed to the poor performance, the sources said. They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar\'s coffee busheswere planted before 1930. The sources said Madagascar was still a long way fromreaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year andthe export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government\'s1986-1990 five-year plan. In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, thegovernment has decided to plant 20,000 hectares withhigh-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sourcessaid. The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed atproducing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a lowcaffeine content. The sources added that Madagascar\'s plan to export roastedcoffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year. Reuter',1 COFFEE}

{0 'European Community (EC) industryministers today declared there is a need for a massive round ofclosures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-countrybloc into reasonable balance with demand. The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntaryplant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Euroferwhich it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs. Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to thescheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis fordiscussion, but did not go nearly far enough. Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure ofplants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes,provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the ECor national governments for redundancy and other social costs. But EC Executive Commission sources said IndustryCommissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mlntonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and shouldbe closed by the end of 1990. He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpointthe scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products,typically produced in plants employing thousands of people. The sources said no minister challenged Narjes\' analysisthat four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have toclose. They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should beexpanded and developed through meetings among the industrybody, the Commission and representatives of member states. However, diplomats said it was clear from today\'sdiscussions that such meetings will be difficult. They said member states are split on whether to reduce thescope of a quota production system, which at present protectsEC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct oftheir products, while talks on the closure plan proceed. It was also clear that there will be tough talks on whichEC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and onhow much funding for help to those thrown out of work shouldcome from Community coffers. German minister Martin Bangemann said his country\'s steelindustry, the largest in the EC, should not sufferproportionately more than others, German sources said. But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw,insists that the profitability of companies should be takeninto account. The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting frommassive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, iscurrently one of the few EC steel companies in the black. Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a jointstatement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in theindustry. Reuter',1 IRON-STEEL}

{0 'Panama Canal toll charges will not risein the year to end-September 1988, despite last October\'slandslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into thewaterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said. He told a press conference that in confirming theCommission\'s earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988,he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989. The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss inthe current financial year but this could be carried over andmet from next year\'s revenues. This year\'s deficit resulted from the landslide which costthe canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said.

{0 'A new International Natural RubberAgreement (INRA) will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman ofthe negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said. \"The successful negotiation of the new agreement representsa significant step forward in international economiccooperation,\" he told a news conference. The new INRA is toreplace the current one which expires in October. Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under theauspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a newaccord last weekend. Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicativeprices set in the present pact. Price levels will continue to be expressed in the jointMalaysian/Singapore currency, he added. The new agreement also maintains the basic structure ofprice ranges -- the \"may sell\" and \"may buy\" points at plus andminus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the \"must sell\"and \"must buy\" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it. Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives thatwere set in the present accord. \"The most important of these areto stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth betweendemand and supply,\" he said. The buffer stock remains the soleinstrument of market intervention for price stabilisation andits maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xutoadded. At this month\'s session, which was the fourth attempt intwo years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to beresolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the referenceprice. It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference priceevery 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals. The extent of the adjustment was also modified. Under the present agreement if the daily market indicatorprice has been above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price(currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lowerintervention price (\"may buy\") price (171 cents at present) forsix months, the reference price is then revised by five pct orwhatever amount the International Natural Rubber Councildecides. Under the new pact, the adjustment under thesecircumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on ahigher adjustment. Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of threepct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higherpercentage. Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers hadstrongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the referenceprice and the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn lastFriday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend. Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details ofthe new pact. On the question of conditions for entry into force of thenew INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governmentsaccounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of worldimports approved or ratified the new agreement before it becameoperational. The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct. Reuter',1 RUBBER}

{0 'Sugar which EC producers plan to sellinto intervention may be offered by the European Commission forsale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in itslatest sugar review. The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a verynominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to theintervention price, with detrimental consequences forproducers\' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as anattempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrenderedsugar. The Commission may also take other steps to dissuadeproducers from their chosen course, such as removing the timelimit on storage contracts, which presently means thatintervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of productionquotas being reduced. If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders forexport, the restitutions would have to be higher than those atrecent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the differencebetween the EC price and the world market price, the extracosts might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says. The producers might have to repay these costs throughproduction levies and the proposed special elimination levy,Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costscould be recovered under EC rules. The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes ofsugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with theEC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed tobridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form ofprotest designed to force the Commission\'s hand. In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered forintervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensurethat the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,West German producers face a further price reduction in Julywith a probable revaluation of the \"green\" mark. Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem isnot expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared totraders for some years that the EC\'s export policy isinsufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, itsays. The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand byincreasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says,suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cutdown the amount of \"unnecessary bureaucracy\" surrounding theexport tender system.

{0 'The Association of German CooperativeBanks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rateswould continue to remain low for the time being. It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strongforeign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors inthe economy that could affect the long-term capital market. The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion forhigher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflationlate this year could give very slight grounds for a rise innominal rates at year\'s end and next year, it said. The association said generally low interest rates,prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expectedstrong domestic demand led it to believe that the investmentclimate would remain friendly and the economy would continueits slow but very sure growth. The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interestrates down on the short-term money market although its policieshad exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,which was so important for investment financing and thus forthe course of the economy, it said. In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policyhad in influencing the longer-term capital market, theassociation saw little sense in wanting to boost the economythrough a short-term and expansionist monetary policy. On the other hand it also saw no reason for stickingdogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.

{0 'Slower than expected growth in Britain\'snarrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur afurther cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling\'svalue requires such a move, economic analysts said. M0, the only targeted money supply measure left afterChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the officialtarget for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budgetspeech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February. On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct. \"The M0 data are much better than we expected,\" said RobertThomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities. He and other analysts said while the better than expectedM0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a newinterest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move. Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despitebuoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pctafter a fall of the same size in January. Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations inconsumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was notan adequate indicator to determine interest rates. \"The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 isimportant ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rateand the election which call the tune,\" Lloyds Merchant bankchief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment. Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett,said in a comment: \"It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond tosignals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange ratetrends is necessary before action is taken.\" \"With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres aremade in response to signals from this narrow money variable,the City has been forced to take it seriously,\" he added. Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end oflast year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared. This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K.Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up thepound above unofficial targets, analysts said. Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreedbetween finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada attheir Paris meeting last month, they added. U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since theParis agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday whenforeign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cutin 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget. They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers andanalysts expect them to shed another half-point in the comingweek. Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher thanexpected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed theannual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previoustarget of 11 to 15 pct. Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate theimprovement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past fewmonths had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only bedrawn after revised data are released on March 31.

{0 'Slower than expected growth in Britain\'snarrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur afurther cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling\'svalue requires such a move, economic analysts said. M0, the only targeted money supply measure left afterChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the officialtarget for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budgetspeech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February. On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct. \"The M0 data are much better than we expected,\" said RobertThomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities. He and other analysts said while the better than expectedM0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a newinterest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move. Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despitebuoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pctafter a fall of the same size in January. Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations inconsumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was notan adequate indicator to determine interest rates. \"The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 isimportant ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rateand the election which call the tune,\" Lloyds Merchant bankchief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment. Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett,said in a comment: \"It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond tosignals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange ratetrends is necessary before action is taken.\" \"With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres aremade in response to signals from this narrow money variable,the City has been forced to take it seriously,\" he added. Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end oflast year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared. This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K.Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up thepound above unofficial targets, analysts said. Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreedbetween finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada attheir Paris meeting last month, they added. U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since theParis agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday whenforeign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cutin 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget. They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers andanalysts expect them to shed another half-point in the comingweek. Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher thanexpected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed theannual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previoustarget of 11 to 15 pct. Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate theimprovement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past fewmonths had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only bedrawn after revised data are released on March 31.

{0 'A statement yesterday by Secretaryof State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers thatU.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced wassignificant in that he recognized the importance of the Sovietmarket and the need for U.S. prices to be at world marketlevels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said. They said that Shultz\'s comments, while not explicitlyendorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthybecause they were not negative towards such action. In response to a query on what the State Department\'sposition is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz toldthe leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers thatprices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade. The Soviet Union, the world\'s largest grain importer, hasbought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining theprice was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fallto sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the exportenhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price. Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheatoffer last year and has been reported to be one of the majorobstacles in making another subsidy overture to the SovietUnion, grain industry sources said. Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheatoffer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly inrecent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures roseanother 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs. \"I\'m not sure this is an about-face, but it\'s clearly arecognition that unless we\'re competitive, we won\'t sell to theSoviet Union,\" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group. \"We have to be competitive. It\'s ridiculous to say thatsomebody is going to buy your product if they can get the samething at a lower price somewhere else,\" Shultz told the farmleaders. \"That is our approach in negotiations with theSoviets,\" he said. If those comments do signal that the State Department is nolonger opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer toMoscow, an industry lobbyst said. National Wheat Grower\'s officials were taking a cautiousattitude towards the secretary\'s comments. \"His comments were not discouraging, but they didn\'t in ourjudgment promise any immediate action on EEP,\" an official withthe wheat group said.

{0 'The \"cross field allowance\" relief onPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRTpaying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct ofqualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability ofother fields. It is restricted to new offshore developmentsoutside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field notpaying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directlybenefit in PRT saving on an existing field. \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participatorsin those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said,adding that the timing of development of such fields may beadvanced. The government would in effect be subsidising thesedevelopments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure beforecorporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit isof timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields willbe reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields willrise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that whenthe rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-payingfield such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in theU.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for asmall non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there willbe a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not onlywill these costs be unavailable for offset against the field\'sfuture profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs willbe lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development startswill have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a latertime. Reuter',1 CRUDE}
{0 'Several leading farm-stateCongressmen said they will press the U.S. AgricultureDepartment to implement some kind of marketing loan to makesoybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income. Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairmanDan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen andrepresentatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on thesubject in the next two weeks. \"Let\'s see if we can try to push them (USDA) to dosomething without legislation,\" Glickman told the hearing. The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs perbushel with no income protection, or marketing loan. David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, presidentsaid USDA must make changes in the soybean program. The current soybean program \"gave us the worst of bothworlds,\" ASA\'s Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate istoo high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion ofsoybean production in South America, he said. At the same time,the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any incomesupport for soybean farmers, Haggard said. \"We need some kind of market loan,\" he added. The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the AgricultureSecretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDAso far has resisted pressure to use the authority. Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if theywould seriously consider offering a marketing loan. USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said thesoybean situation is a \"dilemna\" which has been studiedextensively by the department. But he did not say what, if anychanges, are under consideration. In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways otherthan a marketing loan which should be considered to helpsoybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment,or a direct payment program. Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity CreditCorporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will riseto 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu ofsoybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year. \"Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil\'s entiresoybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,\" Haggard said. However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious inmaking soybean program changes that might allow the EuropeanCommunity to challenge the U.S. program under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT. He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybeanproduction and loss of that market would be devastating. The Reagan administration has given \"mixed signals\" onwhether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could besuccessfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said. While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per buloan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorseda proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a sixdlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan. The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the rankingRepublican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. EdwardMadigan of Illinois. Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to takesome action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loancould mean a substantial increase in budget costs. Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut oneto 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and thereforemust fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget. Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bucombined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price mightfall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost thegovernment a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costswould decline as market prices recovered. Reuter',1 OILSEED}

At the same time,the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any incomesupport for soybean farmers, Haggard said. \"We need some kind of market loan,\" he added. The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the AgricultureSecretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDAso far has resisted pressure to use the authority. Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if theywould seriously consider offering a marketing loan. USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said thesoybean situation is a \"dilemna\" which has been studiedextensively by the department. But he did not say what, if anychanges, are under consideration. In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways otherthan a marketing loan which should be considered to helpsoybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment,or a direct payment program. Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity CreditCorporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will riseto 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu ofsoybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year. \"Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil\'s entiresoybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,\" Haggard said. However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious inmaking soybean program changes that might allow the EuropeanCommunity to challenge the U.S. program under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT. He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybeanproduction and loss of that market would be devastating. The Reagan administration has given \"mixed signals\" onwhether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could besuccessfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said. While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per buloan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorseda proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a sixdlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan. The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the rankingRepublican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. EdwardMadigan of Illinois. Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to takesome action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loancould mean a substantial increase in budget costs. Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut oneto 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and thereforemust fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget. Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bucombined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price mightfall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost thegovernment a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costswould decline as market prices recovered. Reuter',1 SOYBEAN}

{0 'Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said thatrelatively stable oil prices and the bank\'s planned merger withChemical New York Corp <CHL> would help 1987 earnings increasefrom last year\'s profits of 20 mln dlrs. Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview withReuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expectedearnings to increase. \"We would anticipate that this year would be an improvementover last because we are stronger,\" Love said, referring toTexas Commerce\'s pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, willlower Texas Commerce\'s cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15basis points, Love said. The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisitionby a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approvedinterstate banking effective January 1. Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas\'struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to reportprofits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank whichearned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc <ALBN> lost 17.6mln dlrs, MCorp <M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation <FBT>, which is activelyseeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mlndlrs. Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on itsenergy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank\'snonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987. \"I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,\" hesaid. \"The fact that the real estate market is still movingaway suggests there could be some continuing growth ofnonperforming loans.\" In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce\'s net loan lossesrelated to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energyloan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of thebank\'s losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43pct. More than half of Texas Commerce\'s nonperforming loans,which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mlndlrs the year before, were in real estate. Love said he believed the real estate loan problems forTexas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by thethird or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty officebuildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to fouryears, he said. \"I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oilat 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs abarrel,\" he said. Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separatesubsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand itsholdings throughout Texas, offering additional products tobuild up its consumer banking business, Love said. \"We areresuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,\"he said. In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank inMontgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. TexasCommerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in theDallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 memberbanks, he said. One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announcedin December, InterFirst Corp <IFC> and RepublicBank Corp <RPT>,both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valuedat 570 mln dlrs. The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank andInterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallasbanking market, has not changed Texas Commerce\'s expansionplans for the state\'s second-largest city, Love said. \"We thinkwe can try to get a little part of their roost,\" he said. The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce anedge in developing new consumer products, he said. \"We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more thanone million customers all over the state. Chemical will show ushow to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,\" hesaid, referring to expansion of such existing products ascredit cards and investment banking. Reuter',1 EARN}

{0 'American Express Co\'s plan to sell astake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be aprelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,analysts said. American Express earlier said it has a generalunderstanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs. The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,as investors speculated on the possibility of more investmentin the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns. The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response tothe relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents aprice of 2.7 times book value. Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insidertrading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8times book value. American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. Forthe last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors ofa spinoff of part of Shearson. Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit willbenefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasinglyimportant Tokyo financial markets. \"I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step,\" saidLong. \"What you will see probably in the future is AmericanExpress selling an additional 17 pct in the public market andhave a public vehicle for Shearson,\" Long said. \"Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitmentinto an illiquid situation,\" he said of Nippon. Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake inShearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, likeother investment banks, needs capital to expand globally. American express has said the total employees of shearsonwill expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, thatnumber is substantially lower than growth last year, a companyspokesman said. American Express officials would not comment beyond astatement made this morning. That statement, however, did notclose off the possibility of a public offering or other optionfor Shearson. David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possibleShearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believesthe firm will digest the Nippon investment first. \"I think they\'ll figure out what they\'re going to do withthe money they have,\" he said. Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also saidAmerican Express could determine to sell shares to the public. In its statement, the financial services giant said it iscontinuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition tothe investment by Nippon. American Express said options under study range fromexpanding Shearson\'s capacity to meet international competitionto broadening its access to capital. American Express also said the options reflect thecontinuing integral role of Shearson in American Express\'worldwide financial services strategy. Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding aJapanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake toSumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion. Analysts speculated there will be more such matches. \"Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. Theydon\'t have the money. There\'s just not enough internal capitalgrowth,\" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows otherU.S. brokerage companies. Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, areinterested in the expertise of American brokers. \"Those(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies havethe capital needs and the growth opportunities to use themoney.

Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last monthher bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986. Atthe end of 1985 the bank, with 13.8 billion baht of assets, wasranked 12th among Thailand\'s 16 local commercial banks. Waree said Sayam Bank was trying to recall about six toseven billion baht of loans extended by its previous privatemanagement and was taking legal action to collect another fourto five billion baht of doubtful debts.

Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcanegrowers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all faceserious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrivein time to break the droughts, offical reports, governmentofficials and meteorologists said. Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, saidthe drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinceshave been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months. Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added. Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuanwas 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure forover 20 years, the paper said. The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pctcompared with last March and lowered the water levels of manyrivers, it added. This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causingshortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of theYangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing manyships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said. Unusually high temperatures have also been reported acrossChina, media reports said. The People\'s Daily said Sichuan hasrecorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than averagesince early February. The New China News Agency said the average Decembertemperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higherthan last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984. Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lankaand threatens to reduce the country\'s tea crop, Ministry ofPlantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia, concern is growing about below-averagerainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along theQueensland coast and in Western Australia\'s wheat belt, localMeteorological Bureau officials said. For many farmers and government officials the fear is thatwhile the present low rainfall does not yet pose a majorthreat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when thewheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added. Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 droughtwhich devastated the wheat crop and coincided with theoccurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known asEl Nino, they said. Although meteorologists are cautious about linking theAsia-Pacific region\'s disrupted weather patterns to any singlecause, El Nino\'s role is being closely studied, they said. Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data foragriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino \'event\'was unique. The El Nino does not always produce the same effects andthe present occurrence is much less pronounced than the lastmajor event in 1982/83, it said. El Nino, Spanish for \"Christ Child\" because it appears aroundChristmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing cloudsand rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coastof Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated withthe Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the tradewinds, meteorologists said. The winds, strengthened by El Nino\'s \"pump\" effect, raise thesea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said. When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sendsa surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where itcollides with the cold seas off Peru, they said. One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect therain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into thePacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns. The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weathersaid. China, where the affected areas have received between 40and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for theMay-September rains, it said. The May-September rains normally provide thedrought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall. In Australia, areas of Queensland\'s coastal strip havereceived less than half the normal rainfall during the currentwet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishingas the rainy season draws to an end.

The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting ofconsumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problemis already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economicdangers. \"For many third world nations, the loss of the forestis not just a loss of resources,\" said Delfin Ganapin, aPhilippine government consultant on environmental impact. \"In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest,now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitablelogging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of loggingforeign exchange earnings is serious,\" he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas thatare now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result,the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is inthe upland areas, said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoodshave less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no knownway to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within. \"No replanting programme has been successful,\" said AlmyHafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the nexttwo years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denudedland in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from thedevelopment banks, the vicious circle will continue withcountries cutting more forest to help service short-term debtsat the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is notnecessarily the most direct economic product of the forests,and nations must be educated in how best to \"farm\" them, saidPeter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the endproducts of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs ayear, he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredientsto higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of furtherdiscoveries and force major corporations to research, developand produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientistssay is incalculable. By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still beexporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earningswill drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than twobillion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank,Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84,only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said. WWF statistics show half of the world\'s tropical forestshave vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining,up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive loggingpractises and by local farmers. REUTER',1 LUMBER}

A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swissfranc market and a debate on the use of registered shares toprevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.

However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. Therecent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> to take over HeroConserven Lenzburg <HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someonewho was not eligible according to the company\'s statutes.

The study has not beenofficially released due to objections from some countries. Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept therelease of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said.OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meetingin mid-May. One agriculture ministry source said the study so far wasbased on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have droppedsharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said. \"The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it doesnot take account of various differences in farming conditionsin each country, such as geography,\" the source said. He said it is highly likely that the final study will showJapan has the highest farm subsidies in the world. \"This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan\'s farmmarket further, but this would have little impact on Japan\'sagriculture policy,\" he said, without giving further details.

Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a newsconference the Bank will also limit credits on the call moneymarket from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum creditamount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling. \"The recent introduction of three-month money and these newregulations are decreasing the role of the call money marketand the discount rate as monetary instruments,\" Kullberg said. Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying thesewere needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bankof Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs,they said. \"The central bank for the first time has an instrument withwhich it really can influence the price of money in thiscountry,\" one banker said. Under the new rules banks are limited to call money creditsto a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capitaland cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is nowintroduced if the limit is exceeded. Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland\'s monetarydepartment said he expected the bank to pursue an active policyon the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs. \"We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue thefirst, just to see how the system functions.

He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with athree-month maturity at first as the market was best developedfor paper of that maturity. The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-monthcredits and deposits at rates determined by the central bankand the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditionalovernight call money market. Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from aroundnine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week,while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion. On the interbank market there has been an increasing tradein banks\' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka.

The committee also set conditions for the allocation ofcredits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes inthem, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italycould exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes heldby banks in companies or other banks. Under the ruling, credits given by banks or theirsubsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or moreof the bank\'s capital must not exceed defined limits. The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifthof the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself ortwo-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by thegroup or individual concerned. Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concernsin which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreignbanks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks tosubsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also beexcluded from the conditions. The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules intheir statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holdingfive pct or more of the bank\'s capital are not given privilegedtreatment with regard to credit allocation and terms. With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank ofItaly can exercise supervisory controls when information on abank\'s consolidated activities show single shareholdings in acompany or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly orindirectly.

{0 'Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> isresisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunicationsfirms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force achange in those plans, a company executive said. Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one ofthe two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its shareto three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategyJonathan Solomon told reporters. That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerfulbusiness organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of thePost and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm ofprotest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreignfirms from a meaningful position in the market. Pacific Telesis Group <PAC.N> of the United States alsoholds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia,<International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC). Solomon said that both British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz havewritten to the Japanese government about the planned merger. A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have alsoexpressed opposition to the merger, he said. The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated againthat it sees no need for two competitors to <Kokusai DenshinDenwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international callsfrom Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreignshareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm. In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today metFumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrangethe merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked. At stake is C and W\'s 400 mln dlr project to lay fibreoptic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of itsglobal network. \"C and W wants to start right away on the project, such asapplication and other procedures,\" said Watanabe, who is alsochairman of <Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>.

{0 'West Germany\'s money supply growthslowed in February after January\'s sharp rise but the trend isstill definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement. Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was onlymoderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits withstatutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusuallystrongly in January. In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdingsof German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjustedannual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January. Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct. In the six months to February, M2, which excludes timedeposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cashand sight deposits, rose seven pct. International transactions of non-banks again led to asignificant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said. Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank againstforeigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1billion marks in February, little changed from January\'s rise. But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of theinflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionaryeffect on money growth, the Bundesbank said. Outstanding bank credits to companies and privateindividuals remained virtually unchanged in February. A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflectedthe foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise inlong-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities. At the end of February total bank credits to the privatesector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level. The effect of public authority cash movements on the moneysupply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said. Although banks acquired large amounts of public authoritypaper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercialbanks and the Bundesbank. Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed moneysupply growth to a larger extent than in January. A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placedwith banks after 6.6 billion the previous month. REUTER',1 MONEY-SUPPLY}

{0 'The European Community Commission hascharged the United States with breaking international traderules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market andsaid it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT. In the latest of a series of trade disputes withWashington, the executive authority alleged that a section ofthe U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminatedagainst imported products in favour of domestically-producedgoods. The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to ruleon whether the section in question, which officials said hadproved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules. Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measuresif, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed tobring the disputed section into line with international rules. The executive\'s decision to go to GATT follows a complaintto it by the Dutch company Akzo <AKZO.AS>, whose \"aramid\"synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market becauseof charges by the U.S. Firm <Dupont> that the fibres violatethe American company\'s patents. Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S.International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory andincompatible with GATT provisions. The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of theU.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction over importedproducts. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did nothave the same possibilities for defending themselves before theITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court. \"Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourablethan that which takes places in normal courts of law for goodsproduced in the United States,\" it said in a statement.

The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S.Complaint, starting with informal consultations and thenholding a special session in July, trade officials said. \"The tension has eased,\" the permanent trade ambassador ofthe 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters.\"The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels.\" U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over whatthey call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during avisit to European capitals in February. In a letter calling for the special committee meeting,Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain andthe EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus. The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating ruleslaid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.

He also praised \"the spirit of \'give\' and \'take\' thatprevailed throughout this session.\" Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers,said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutualityof interests between producers and consumers is now as valid asit was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the1970s. Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basisof predictable stable prices is \"a vital consideration formultinational tire companies, whether or not consumingcountries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriouslyconcerned about security of the rubber supply.\" He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement hadserved the purpose for which it was created. Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accessionto the new pact \"to avoid an undue gap between the old and thenew. Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers,agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well. But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumershad been led to make proposals for improving its functioning.

Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of theEF Hutton publication \"Global Crop News,\" said in her latestreport that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,from the U.S. due to potential crop damage. \"Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Sovietwinter grain crop) is far more pessimistic,\" she said. \"Butit\'s still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lotwill depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of thetroubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting.\" Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probablyprevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheatgrowing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasusreceived on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said. The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke recordlows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken itstoll on Soviet winter crops, she said. However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt hadample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majorityof crop areas from severe frost damage. The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grainsin the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily fromCanada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,Martell said. She cited a number of reasons besides possible cropproblems that might point to additional Soviet import demand. Last fall\'s dry weather may limit livestock grazing onmoisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weathernecessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy. Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobylaccident may have contaminated more grain than originallythought and have to be made up with imports. However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of lastresort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have onlyjust recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn. Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to theUSSR during years of heavy Soviet demand. In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grainimports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Unionbought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only24 pct of that total.

{0 'Additional capital inflows of 1.5billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico\'s reserves toabout eight billion dlrs, director of public credit AngelGurria told reporters. Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improvedinvestor confidence and because a tight monetray policy hasforced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflowstotalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for thesake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool offunds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan isdrawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only haveenough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four orfive months, Gurria noted. Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw onthe commercial banks\' 1.2 billion dlr investment-supportcontingency facility. That money will be available until April1988 if Mexico\'s export receipts and the price of oil fallbelow certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for thefirst two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria saidtoday, \"We expect we\'ll never have to use it.\" Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw onthe second contingency facility included in the bank financingpackage - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the WorldBank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signedyesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support thedevelopment of exports of manufactured goods. He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billiondlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil andexport promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month. Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from itsInternational Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few daysbased on a successful review of end-1986 economic results. Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages ofdiscussions which will determine quantitative economic targetsfor 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMFfor the rest of 1987. Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eightbilateral accords with government creditors within the ParisClub. Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrellaagreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrsof official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalizepacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks. In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, hesaid all countries from the Organization of EconomicCooperation and Development have continued to provide exportcredit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.

{0 'The European Community (EC) agreedtough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks andbuses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vaststretches of the region\'s forests. Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreedmember states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next fewyears the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the mainsource of acid rain endangering forests and lakes. The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, withtougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 andfor all new vehicles from October 1990. The EC\'s executive Commission says the emission level ofnitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a yearfrom three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if allheavy vehicles applied to the new standards. There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use inthe EC, according to Commission figures. The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to movetowards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonnrequested permission to do so to encourage the use oflow-pollution cars, diplomats said. West Germany will still need ministers\' final approval forsuch a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when ECenvironment ministers meet next on May 21. But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germanydid not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wideban on the sale of regular leaded petrol. Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomatssaid. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk nodamage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol. Under EC law, ministers have to give member states specialpermission if they wish to be exempt from Community competitionlaws.
