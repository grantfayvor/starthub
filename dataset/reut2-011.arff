{0 'U.S. refiners will have toreduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, saidindustry officials attending the National Petroleum RefinersAssociation meeting here. \"If the refining sector can discipline itself to refineabout 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance topull down inventories to acceptable levels by the secondquarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president ofpetroluem products at Conoco Inc \"If not, the industry will have a tough 1987,\" he added. Last week\'s American Petroleum Institute report said thatU.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the weekended March 20. The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-agolevels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year\'s level, theAPI said. Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp<CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return toprofitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstreamoperations to produce an acceptable level of earnings. \"The jump in refining capacity is a concern if itcontinues,\" said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president ofrefining and marketing at <Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S.subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France. Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity giventhe current level of demand but the operating level shouldincrease as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter,Buckler said. Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S.refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crudeper day. \"I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineriesover the next five years,\" he said, adding that thesefacilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crudeoil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity torefine 15.6 mln bpd of crude. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

{0 'A high level U.S. trade officialsaid it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against theUnited States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductorelectronics products. Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliateagainst U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce BruceSmart replied, \"That would be the height of foolishness.\" In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress inmeeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actualimposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17. Japan\'s 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the UnitedStates last year has come under fire in Congress concernedabout the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with therecord 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986. President Reagan\'s sanctions decision won praise today fromthe two Democratic leaders of Congress. \"I think it\'s about time,\" Senate Democratic Leader RobertByrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wrightof Texas told reporters before the opening of the Housesession, \"It just shows we were right all along when we saidsomething needs doing.\" Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearingthat last Friday\'s U.S. trade action would help U.S.negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts. Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open upJapan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts.

Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987. \"It\'s amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised.

{0 'The Federal Reserve\'s move to easiermonetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount ratecuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in thesecond quarter, analysts said. A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates toedge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending ratefrom 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy. \"The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further withouta full-blown recession,\" said Raymond Stone, chief financialeconomist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Stone said economic data available by late June may be justweak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he saidit may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual halfpoint, to avoid hurting the dollar further. All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open MarketCommittee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged. The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughlyquarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasurybond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at whichbanks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the primelending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct. Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly tothe April-June quarter, follow: - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct furtheragainst other major currencies because of a large U.S. budgetdeficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted afterthe dollar\'s steep drop in the last two business days, theeconomists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is thatthe dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect. - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continuetrading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could welltest the lower end of that range. - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter andprobably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strongforeign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. Theoutlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the yearsince both inflation and interest rates may be edging up. - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflatorwill rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. Thesharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as willa mild economic pickup in the second half of this year. - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pctannual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand atrespective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 firstand second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pctannualrate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International seesboth the strongest economy and the highest interest rates amongthose surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pctrate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate thisquarter and 3.5 pct next quarter. \"The economy will bounce back more strongly than manyexpect,\" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup ininventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quartereconomic growth, with consumer spending helping later. \"We\'re running out of special factors to keep the economyafloat,\" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. Hisinterest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest. Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulationhelped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that secondquarter growth could be zero or negative. Braverman said economic activity next quarter will sufferfrom a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow government spending and less construction. Only a marginallynarrower trade deficit will add to growth. He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,respectively. Nikko\'s Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct forbonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate. Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildlyafter the dollar\'s fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in pastdays and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan. David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Incraised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct. Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, liftedhis forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a pointto eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds.

{0 'The Federal Reserve\'s move to easiermonetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount ratecuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in thesecond quarter, analysts said. A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates toedge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending ratefrom 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy. \"The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further withouta full-blown recession,\" said Raymond Stone, chief financialeconomist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Stone said economic data available by late June may be justweak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he saidit may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual halfpoint, to avoid hurting the dollar further. All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open MarketCommittee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged. The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughlyquarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasurybond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at whichbanks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the primelending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct. Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly tothe April-June quarter, follow: - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct furtheragainst other major currencies because of a large U.S. budgetdeficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted afterthe dollar\'s steep drop in the last two business days, theeconomists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is thatthe dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect. - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continuetrading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could welltest the lower end of that range. - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter andprobably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strongforeign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. Theoutlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the yearsince both inflation and interest rates may be edging up. - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflatorwill rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. Thesharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as willa mild economic pickup in the second half of this year. - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pctannual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand atrespective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 firstand second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pctannualrate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International seesboth the strongest economy and the highest interest rates amongthose surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pctrate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate thisquarter and 3.5 pct next quarter. \"The economy will bounce back more strongly than manyexpect,\" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup ininventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quartereconomic growth, with consumer spending helping later. \"We\'re running out of special factors to keep the economyafloat,\" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. Hisinterest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest. Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulationhelped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that secondquarter growth could be zero or negative. Braverman said economic activity next quarter will sufferfrom a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow government spending and less construction. Only a marginallynarrower trade deficit will add to growth. He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,respectively. Nikko\'s Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct forbonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate. Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildlyafter the dollar\'s fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in pastdays and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan. David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Incraised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct. Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, liftedhis forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a pointto eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho andResler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.

AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is aunit of AMR Corp. The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger planFeb. 20. American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms ofrevenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively smallcarrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is thenation\'s 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would notalter American\'s third-place ranking, according to datacompiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine. The combination would incrase American\'s share of the U.S.market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said. The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantiallyreduce competition on the four routes on which both carriersprovide either nonstop or single-plane service. At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOTsaid it found no evidence that other carriers could notincrease or begin service that competed with a mergedAmerican-AirCal. Concerning the 14th, \"While entry may not be possible at theOrange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that theservice provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, willprovide effective competition for Orange County travelers inlong-haul markets,\" the DOT said. The merger would give American control of 37 pct of theauthorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange Countyterminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminalbuilding limit future opportunities for expansion. The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed commentsopposing the merger but \"raised no new facts or arguments.\" Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American willpay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings.

{0 'Development of costly shale oil,liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted inrecent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies,will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs abarrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said. Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters afteraddressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute ofChemical Engineers, \"By early in the next century, syntheticsshould play a significant role in this country\'s energysupply.\" McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that hebelieved synthetic fuels would become economic to develop whenworld oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range. \"You\'re talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oilprices, but I think that time is coming and we\'ve got to beprepared,\" McMillan said. He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pctannually in the next few years while the nation fails toreplace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn ofthe century, world oil prices will be significantly higherbecause of declining supplies, McMillan said. Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at themeeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to helpspur development of synthetic fuels. The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tonsof demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple thatof all the world\'s known oil reserves. \"We must encourage research now in order to make synfuelscompetitive later,\" Hall said. The average lead time fordevelopment of a shale oil or liquified coal project is betweenfive and ten years. Until last year, the federal government had subsidizedsynfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., aresearch program created during the Carter Administration withthe goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrelsof oil.

{0 'Canada\'s major banks will likely facestiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performingif, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after theend of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said. American bankers said last week that slow progress in debttalks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. bankswould soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing. Such action \"would put a lot of pressure on the Canadianbanks to do the same,\" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bankanalyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters. \"They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,\" saidPulcine, \"and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performingbasis and the Canadian banks don\'t, there is going to be a lotof pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is consideringthe loans non-performing and another bank is not.\" Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said anywillingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp<CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather thanlet Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compellingexample for other creditor banks. \"In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) haveto have the support of the other banks,\" said Meredith. Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltdsaid at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify,\"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basisand is trying to encourage the others to take that position.\" Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrsby Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments onits 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt. Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 daysbefore declaring loans on which they are receiving no interestas non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days.They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans untillate May, which falls in Canadian banks\' third quarter endingJuly 31. <Bank of Montreal>, Brazil\'s largest Canadian bankcreditor, said last week it was not currently consideringdeclaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans asnon-performing. \"I think that is just for the benefit of the public,\" Walshsaid of Bank of Montreal\'s statement. Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadianbanks from a move to declare the Brazilian loansnon-performing. They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments bythe banks\' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banksto recoup their lost interest income. \"From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the bankswill get the money,\" said Meredith. \"My outlook at this point isoptimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year\'searnings.\" Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of3.80 dlrs for <Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in1986; 4.30 dlrs for <Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25dlrs for <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with2.23; 2.15 dlrs for <Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94,and 2.85 dlrs for <Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74. She forecast 1.90 dlrs for <National Bank of Canada>against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split. Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earningsestimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share,assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil\'s interest costs. \"If the banks didn\'t receive anything for the rest of thefiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts ashare. But I don\'t see that as a likely scenario,\" Pulcine said. Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that theBrazilian debt situation was so complex that \"it could drag onbeyond one full fiscal year.\" He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earningsforecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil\'s yearlyinterest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrsor about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings. Reuter',1 EARN}

Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reformplan, may now be forced to resign before the June economicsummit of seven industrialised nations if local elections laternext month go against candidates from his ruling LiberalDemocratic Party (LDP), they said. \"The close relationship between Nakasone and PresidentReagan was an important element of Nakasone\'s power base,\"Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchidatold Reuters. \"So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damagesNakasone.\" Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone wasencountering criticism not only from opposition parties butalso within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax. \"Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves fromNakasone,\" Uchida said. \"His position within the LDP itself isnot so strongly established today.\" Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general publicthan with many LDP members, is now seeing his public supporteroded, the analysts said. The yen\'s rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat onFriday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods inretaliation for Japan\'s alleged violation of a microchip tradepact are now giving Nakasone\'s critics fresh ammunition, theanalysts said. \"Apparently the special relationship between Reagan andNakasone hasn\'t worked effectively,\" Rei Shiratori, director ofthe Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said. This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone\'scredibility, Shiratori told Reuters. The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen\'srise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP lossesin the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said. \"If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have toresign early,\" Shiratori said. But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempersbefore or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,some analysts said. However, \"unless the Japanese political system can move morequickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take toWashington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a veryhostile audience,\" said Merrill Lynch Securities economistWilliam Sterling. \"If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put thefinal nail in his coffin,\" he said. Reagan\'s own weakened domestic position, and growingRepublican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argueagainst a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analystssaid. But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupledwith uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors toNakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over thedifferences and aid Nakasone, they said. \"One factor against a trade war may be that Washington isnot anxious to push Nakasone into his grave,\" Sterling said.

The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a jointstatement. The previously announced float of part of its Delhiinterest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement. Delhi Australia Fund owns <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, whichholds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-ledCooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects. In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equallyin any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensateprices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi\'sinterests in the next two years, the statement said. \"The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest willbe more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with thefloat,\" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement. Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focusefforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and buildingmaterials in which CSR has had long and successful managementexperience and strong market leadership. With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businessesmore aggressively and earlier, he said. As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhisale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <PioneerSugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing itsentire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs. After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin isAustralia\'s largest oil and gas producing area with currentgross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gasliquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubicfeet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said. The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The BrokenHill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshoreproduction in Australia, they said. Esso\'s chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assistin maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in theCooper-Eromanga area. \"These discoveries will help Australia\'s self-sufficiency inoil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in BassStrait production now under way,\" McGill said. In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelmansaid CSR was within days of completing plans for the float ofCSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso. He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decisionin view of the risks associated with the oil business. The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to shareequally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average morethan 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said. Kelman said a revaluation of CSR\'s investment in Delhi tonet realisable value as of today, CSR\'s annual balance-date,will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs. However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assetswill significantly reduce this loss, he said. He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by futureprospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in corebusinesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payablein July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 centsagainst 18 in 1985/86.

The official said it was encouraging that Japan had agreednot to reduce ore imports from India although Japan\'s totaliron ore imports would be lower in the coming year because ofthe recession in the Japanese steel industry. He said Japanese ore imports in calendar 1987 would total96 mln tonnes, compared with 103.5 mln in 1986.

{0 'Rising imports of Japanese-made cars andelectronic goods may upset West European officials, but theygenerally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latesttrade row between the United States and Japan. Japan\'s huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair tradepractices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold. The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficitwith Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanesetrade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said. But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of actingwith the U.S. To do something about Japan\'s huge trade surplus. \"The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is theU.S.,\" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade PolicyResearch Centre in London. \"Basically, their policies are prettymuch the same.\" But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Orthat the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage ofthe U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said. \"In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,\" headded. \"In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic offree competition, while in Europe, the general approach is thatliberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.\" Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington\'stendency to impose so-called \"countervailing duties\" - an importtax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair. In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends tobe to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said. In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan hasthreatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronicgoods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan hasfailed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade. But the European Community has challenged the agreement asa violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)practices that discriminates against its microchip producers. \"It follows that they\'re not likely to rally to the side ofthe United States in defence of the agreement,\" said Wolf. Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a toughline on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the restof Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC takethe lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels toldReuters there has been no change in the Community\'s positionsince a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent astrong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances. In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreignministers deplored Japan\'s continued trade imbalance andappealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said afterthe talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC. Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw nosigns of any immediate intention to impose any broad-rangingsanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking atrade war, they said. Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas inEuropean trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking totry to improve the situation, the diplomats said. In Britain, where the government is angered over thedifficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless hasfaced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials saidlast week that retaliatory action is being considered. But government officials said last night, \"We are nottalking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.\" They said the government would consider its options at acabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisionswere expected. The main thing the British would threaten theJapan with is denial of access to London\'s booming financialmarkets, government officials said. REUTER',1 TRADE}

CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gasinterests held in the <Delhi Australia Fund> and would insteadsell it to Exxon Corp <XON> unit <Esso Exploration andProduction Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs.

A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had givenitself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark onan ambitious expansion programme in its best-performingdivisions of sugar and building products, analysts said. CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the rightto share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from anoil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.

The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far thelargest player in Australia\'s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industryand would give it access to some of the best sugar propertiesand mills in the country, analysts said. They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommendacceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from thebottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne nextseason from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said. Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaginginvestment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company\'soverall performance, analysts said.

Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker <Bain and Co Ltd>said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industrywas a sensible one but added that it represented the loss ofAustralian-owned assets to a foreign company. \"The farm they bought back a few years ago is being soldback to the Americans,\" Goldston-Morris said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far thelargest player in Australia\'s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industryand would give it access to some of the best sugar propertiesand mills in the country, analysts said. They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommendacceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from thebottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne nextseason from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said. Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaginginvestment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company\'soverall performance, analysts said. CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses onwhat had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirelyfrom U.S. Dollar debt, they said. \"It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirelywith debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oilprice collapsed on them,\" Owen Evans of Sydney broker <Mearesand Philips Ltd> said. Esso not only picked up Delhi\'s oil and gas output but alsogained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax lossesaccumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions. Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stakein Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd<BRKN.S>. \"Esso has been very keen to diversify from the GippslandBasin. They haven\'t found too much oil in Bass Strait latelyand Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,\"Goldston-Morris said. REUTER',1 SUGAR}
{0 'CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> has made a bold move inselling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs andploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, shareanalysts said. \"It sounds like a good deal,\" Stuart McKibbin of <A.C. Goodeand Co> told Reuters. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gasinterests held in the <Delhi Australia Fund> and would insteadsell it to Exxon Corp <XON> unit <Esso Exploration andProduction Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia\'s largestsugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct itdoes not already hold in <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>. \"This will be a big shock to the market, which was under theimpression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,\"McKibbin said. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had givenitself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark onan ambitious expansion programme in its best-performingdivisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.

{0 'Consuming countries, chastened by thecollapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price supportoperations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before thatcommodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they areserving, a Reuter survey showed. They want price ranges to be more responsive to markettrends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining theaccords\' support operations - and intervention rules that avoidthe risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations. Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned ageneralised approach to commodity price stabilisation andprefer to assess each commodity case by case, the surveyshowed. The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week setprecise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could dounder the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchaselimits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures marketsand stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct oftotal buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. Thiswill help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, theworld\'s fourth largest producer, undermining the market. The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the BufferStock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades. A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) wasadopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exportingcountries agreed several changes to make the reference pricemore responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisionsunder which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to financeoperations. Direct cash contributions from members will fundbuffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular featureof the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses runninginto hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue. Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiationsin London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist thatagreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said. Consumers and a small group of producers argued that\"objective criteria\" should be used to define export quotashares, which would have meant a reduction in the share ofBrazil, the world\'s leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintainits previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,delegates and trade sources see chances of any near termnegotiations on export quota distribution as remote. International agreements exist for sugar and wheat.

British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to bea two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.

{0 'Leading domestic semiconductor makerswill boost imports and cut production of key memory microchipsfrom next month in line with government attempts to ward offU.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said. The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off thesanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of theplans, analysts said. The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth ofproducts and are in retaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure tohonour a semiconductor trade pact. In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagansaid Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatorypricing and open Japan\'s market to foreign products. But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter saidyesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to dropthe tariffs if Japan shows a \"clear indication\" that it will openits markets to U.S. Goods. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) hasurged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in thesecond quarter, following a call to reduce production by morethan 20 pct the previous quarter. MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports. Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington tocancel the tariffs ahead of next month\'s meeting between PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan. \"The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its swordand shown that it can and will do business,\" said analyst NickEdwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo. But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers cancut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal ofthe sanctions -- is more difficult. \"The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC\'s(integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumerproducts. They\'re well supplied here,\" said Richard May, senioranalyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo. The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC\'s,but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-endproduction skills, the analysts said. \"The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses onsemiconductors in return for free access to other areas,\" saidEdwards. A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T>, said the firm\'sreduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory(256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI\'s efforts to ward off thetrade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result ofthe company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM\'s, he said. Company officials unveiled the following plans - - NEC Corp <NESI.T>, Japan\'s largest chipmaker, plans toslash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct tosix mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln lastquarter. In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chipimports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chipconsumption the year before. - Hitachi Ltd\'s <HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM\'s willfall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. Thecompany is trying to boost imports but has not set a specifictarget. Imports are currently very low. - Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAMproduction by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and isconsidering ways to boost imports, a company official said. Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sellthe U.S. Firm\'s chips in Japan. The firms are planning ajoint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northernJapan. - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim secondquarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mlnchips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increasedimports but an official said \"boosting imports will be difficultas it depends on sales demand.\" - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord withMITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels. - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce Aprilproduction by 10 pct from March\'s 3.2 mln. Oki is studying waysto increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginningApril 1 from the previous year\'s total of more than fivebillion yen, a company official said. REUTER',1 TRADE}

{0 'London and Scottish Marine Oil Plc(Lasmo) <LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices riseagain and it is confident this will happen early in the nextdecade, the company said in a statement accompanying results. Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil andgas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oilequivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every yearsince 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year. The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,down from 118 mln in 1985. It said falling oil prices caused the downturn. The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop inoil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mlnstg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand forlower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide. The company said had very few exploration wells committedfor 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in itsexploration program. Even without further success, the existingfields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly toprofit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.

{0 'One or two large West German bankseffectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity atthe end of the month in order to achieve higher rates fromtheir overnight deposits, money dealers said. As a result, call money soared in active trading to aroundthe Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday asbanks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds. Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at thecentral bank over the first 29 days of the month. Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion. To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raiseholdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today andtomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business becausebanks excessively took up the Bundesbank\'s offer for sale ofTreasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct forthree-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market. Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not returnuntil tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said. Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,commanded short-term money requirements of as much as fivebillion marks or so. With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of themonth, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,draining liquidity for three days. When other banks soughtfunds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excessfunds on deposit at a considerably higher average return. One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advancedknowledge of the market\'s needs, should have curtailed itssales of treasury bills on Friday. Though dealers only late in the day learn of the totalminimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbankhas an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipatethe strength of demand for funds the following day, he said. \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are notselling any treasury bills or we\'re not selling them in thisamount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer themarket then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it willbe different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\" But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump inrates, given the delicate state of currency markets. International central banks have been at pains to prevent adollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmerundertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar. \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of betweenthree and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have todaycannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said. Dealers said the large banks probably achieved averagerates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct orfour pct. This is a higher return than they would have earnedwithout the excessive draining through the treasury billmechanism. Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiationsbetween Germany\'s major employers and the unions, theBundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes tomonetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said. Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on theLombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billionmarks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn inforeign business because of lower energy prices and the highermark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customernations. Domestic business was also declining and orders for WestGerman engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,Dieter said. Mannesmann\'s profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986. Dieter said Mannesmann\'s pipe activities would suffer aset- back, although measures to cut costs, which were startedlast year, were now having an effect. Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related productsaccounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann\'s turnover. Thecompany saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dietersaid had become one of Mannesmann\'s \"strategic aims.\" He said the company\'s drive to combine activities inmechanical and electronic engineering was a particular \"pluspoint\" for Mannesmann. Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to takea majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts groupfor an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fallnine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group netprofit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks. It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollarand lack of demand for steel pipe.

{0 'Aluminium capacity expansion planned forthe period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply anyacceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on thescale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony BirdAssociates\' 1987 Aluminium Review. By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need tobe around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mlntonnes are scheduled, Bird said. Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 andincreased imports by less developed countries. Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerateby as much as general growth, but non-socialist worldconsumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Birdsaid. Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace ofchange after 1973, the review said, and now they have completedthis transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupiedwith the strategies of retrenchment and survival which haveserved them well in recent years. In order to encourage the construction of additionalsmelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higherlevel. Production costs are likely to rise again in the yearsahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricitysuppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies,according to the review. At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-pricescenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said. Such a price development is not expected to cause anymarked competitive problems for the metal because of the likelyrise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in thepipeline for steel and copper. In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said,as the world economy has not responded well to theopportunities offered by cheap oil. Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higherin 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes. Reuter',1 ALUM}

{0 'The Institute for Economic Research(WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria\'s 1987 grossdomestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pctforecast made last December. WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he sawthe one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, asthe upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revisiondue to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added. A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oilproducing states, combined with the effects of the dollar\'sfall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year. Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth thisyear. After last year\'s 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, privateconsumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pctin 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings. Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2pct last year due to the slack economic activity. Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficitof about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billionsurplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria\'scentral bank, last month forecast the current account would beroughly in balance this year. However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should haveno notable effect on the government\'s attempts to cut thebudget deficit.

{0 'Australia faces a major medium termadjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance,the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development saidin its latest annual review of the Australian economy. It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising externaldebt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs andinflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECDcountries. A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basisfor sustained non-inflationary growth and externalcompetitiveness had improved, but economic performance overallhad sharply deteriorated since June 1985. A major shift of real resources to the external sector --about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for theeconomy to expand in line with potential, for employment togrow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said. Success depended on the setting of right policies includingtighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sectorborrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour. Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expectedeconomic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighterfiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement intrade volumes. It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored,the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct ofGDP by the first half of next year, while inflation wasprojected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct bymid-1988. Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintainthe competitive edge created by the Australian dollar\'sdepreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares inorder to encourage business investment. The report urged Australia to broaden its export base bydeveloping viable and competitive service and manufacturingindustries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets tocorrect its external imbalances. It added Australia should reduce protection levels inmanufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would nodoubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry. REUTER',1 GNP}
{0 'Representatives of U.S. sugar growerorganizations said they expect some increase the area plantedto sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987cane sugar crop also are good. Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightlyin the largest producing state of Minnesota. Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in themidwest, and this coupled with increases in California wouldincrease U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mlnacres sown last year. USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report. The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowingsis that returns from competing crops such as soybeans andgrains are \"just awful,\" said Carter. In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers toplant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loanrate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers frombeet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, saidLuther Markwart, executive vice president of the Americansugarbeet growers association. \"The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,\"Markwart said. In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking acontract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said. USDA\'s report today will not include any harvested areaestimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaiiand Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good. Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texascane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start becausefor the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said. In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian SugarPlanters Association. The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more thanthe usual amount of attention this year because of mountingconcern that continued increases in domestic sugar productionthreaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said. The increases in beet plantings have especially causedconcern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said. \"We haven\'t had a good weather year throughout the beet andcane areas in more than five years,\" said Godfrey, adding thatthe U.S. may be due for a good weather year.

He added that in light of the declining demand for steelcapacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government wouldnot successfully be able to stand in the way of any change inthis industry. Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and calledfor more competition, citing as an example the Federal PostOffice.

{0 'Trade estimates of the comingMay/September temporao harvest in Brazil\'s main cocoa growingstate of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bagrange against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago. Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters theeffects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year hadbeen harsher than thought earlier. Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains inmid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing. Last year\'s temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mlnbags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags. The traders said another factor leading to lower croppredictions is that many farmers are not caring properly forplantations because of low returns on their investment. Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back asfarmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over thepast six months coupled with low bean prices. If such economies continue into the winter months both thetemporao and the developing October/April main crop could faceserious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which wouldnormally be treated against the disease. Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolatedincidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions saythese are not yet significant. The traders said they expect very low deliveries oftemporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and thebulk will not appear until the last month, September. Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellentcondition and recent flowering and pod setting - which willlead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good. Reuter',1 COCOA}

{0 'French Prime Minister Jacques Chiracopened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus onsuperpower arms control moves and trade issues. French officials said a major aim of Chirac\'s visit was topresent France\'s concern that the United States might ignoreEuropean security interests in any accord with Moscow onremoving medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent. But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will notagree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would givethe Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomatssaid. France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missilesfrom Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge inother weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,conventional forces and chemical weapons. Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French positionsaying: \"Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces shouldmention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.\" Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending adispute between two leading research institutes over patentrights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS. In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the PasteurInstitute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, ofBethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties fromthe test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fightagainst AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). \"This agreement opens a new era in Franco-Americancooperation, allowing France and the United States to jointheir efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes ofspeeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,\" Reagansaid at the signing ceremony. He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation. The foundation would also raise private funds and woulddonate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in lessdeveloped countries. Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and theUnited States during a welcoming ceremony in the White HouseEast Room, with Reagan describing France as \"America\'s oldestally in war and peace.\" \"I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by thesame ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangerswhich we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, newdiseases and drugs,\" Chirac replied. But the two countries are likely to have less to agree onover the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a risein protectionism in the U.S. Congress. A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea tosell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way oflessening surplus stocks. Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, firstproposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,during his two-day visit to Washington.

{0 'Canada\'s airline industry, shaken up bya recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor forgovernment-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drivefor profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said. \"Now we\'ve got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\"said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.\"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\" The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlrtakeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small butcash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last weekas Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada\'s50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about ninepct. Analysts believe Pacific Western\'s aggressive andcost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the truepotential of the former CP Air, which floundered for fourdecades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian PacificLtd. They said CP Air\'s management style had been not muchdifferent from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, becauseneither airline was held accountable to its owners. \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, thesetwo airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neitherseemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley. \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be veryconscious of profitability and shareholder return. And AirCanada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said. CP Air, always fighting for market share rather thanprofits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn ofBache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulatedlong-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, itslosses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later thisyear in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs onrevenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of morethan 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold tothe public, the prospect of privatization at a time ofincreased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay moreattention to finances, analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"inexcess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profitrecovery was due less to management skill than the fact thatall Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 inVancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct airtraffic growth, and they expect profits will come fromcost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd saidinstitutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to theirportfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that newcompetition makes profit growth less certain. \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. Atone time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobodyelse\'s,\" Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airlineshares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada\'s immediate concern ahead of apublic stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routeswithout setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessaryupdating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase ofa dozen aircraft from Europe\'s Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week orderedsix commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it wouldsoon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or theBoeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these withouthurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects CanadianAirlines\' profit in 1988 will more than double last year\'s 29.8mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. Reuter',1 EARN}

{0 'The threatened trade war between theUnited States and Japan is just the kind of shock thateconomists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin. But they are not so sure if that would be a briefcorrective dip, or whether this week\'s falling share pricesmark the start of a \"bear\" market. \"It\'s the billion dollar question,\" said Richard O\'Brien,economist at American Express International Bank in London. Japan\'s trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- haspoured into share and bond markets around the world, and fundeda good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third ofany new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by theJapanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as thedollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets itfall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart ofimproving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar orbecause the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budgetdeficit. And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese willhave less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill thegap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O\'Brien said. Thesubsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major fallson the world stock markets. \"A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,\"said O\'Brien. \"Now, it is much less certain.\" Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a boomingeconomy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best inthe industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt andhuge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O\'Brien. Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of SmithBarney Harris Upham said \"We\'re still in a bull market,\" addingthat corrections are a normal part of a rising market and \"Thebear usually strikes slowly.\" Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co inLondon, said the huge sums of money going through the worldfinancial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices. Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money innon-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it\'s verydifficult to see where else they can put their money than inU.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,according to David Butcher, a senior executive at YamaichiSecurities Co Ltd\'s bond operation in London. He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention nowto the French franc and West German mark.

Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman willstage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he canadd its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF. \"It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)Jacobs that they don\'t want to be taken over. The question isnow do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they wantto remain independent,\" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps. Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculationfor almost a year. Last week, Jacobs\' investment vehicle,Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mlnBorg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding. Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took nosteps toward a transaction. \"Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them forthe last nine months. It\'s been one of the dullest corporatebattles I\'ve seen,\" said one analyst. The battle, however, has heated up, and the range ofbreakup values on Wall Street span from the current marketprice to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said theythink a price in the low 50s would be appropriate. Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily onits 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner. Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end upwith Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materialscompany in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted anunsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefitedfrom that company\'s restructuring. \"Borg Warner can\'t quibble that it\'s not a legitimateoffer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind ofbetween a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it\'s sweetened. Ipersonally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs pershare,\" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson. Henderson also speculated the company might attempt arestructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire andRubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir JamesGoldsmith. The company bought back the financier\'s stock andcarried out a wider share repurchase. Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman isseeking \"greenmail,\" or the repurchase of his stock by thecompany at a premium. Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems withfinancing the transaction. Previously associated with \"junk bond\" experts, DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warnertakeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tenderoffer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArnerboard and conditioned on the board\'s recommendation of thetender offer and merger. Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects amerger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employeessince the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repaydebt from the transaction. GAF\'s stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8. \"I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at thelevel it is proposing it would enhance GAF share valuessubstantially,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose. He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman\'s average cost for thecompany\'s stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF\'scurrent holdings. Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg\'s earnings. The plastics are used in telephone equipment, officeequipment and appliances. \"Borg has half the market in the U.S.and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,\"Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co <DOW> andMonsanto Corp <MTC>, he said. Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and aprotective systems business, which includes Wells Fargosecurity guards. It also has an information services business,and is trying to sell its financial services business. Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share onrevenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs pershare on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs. GAF\'s net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mlnfrom its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, aspecial union carbide dividend, and the sale of its UnionCarbide shares.

{0 'Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlierreporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlierprofit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to writedowns totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction indeferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs. The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreignexchange losses, the company said. \"The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reversesmuch of the progress the company has made in the two previousyears,\" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement. \"But even a net loss of this magnitude has very littlebearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome,\" chairmanMacdonald said. \"It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of thecompany\'s assets in today\'s economic environment, and theabsolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenderson a debt restructuring plan to assure the company\'s continuedexistence,\" he added. Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan forrestructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs. Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulatedforeign exchange losses to current expenses because of theuncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan. Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remainingperiod of the loans to which they apply, it said. Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarterreduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to acharge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly inthe third quarter. Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter chargeresulted from a year-end accounting change made under new fullcost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute ofChartered Accountants. The company said it previously determined a write down ofconventional oil and gas properties was not required atSeptember 30, under the previous method of calculating thelimitation of oil and gas values. Dome said the most significant accounting change under thenew guidelines is using current oil and gas prices incalculations instead of escalating price forecasts. Terms of Dome\'s proposed debt restructuring plan precludethe company from making an accurate estimate of futurefinancing costs, which are used in the new accountingcalculations, it said. As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantiallyconform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securitiesand Exchange Commission, the company said. Dome said operating income from its crude oil and naturalgas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs. Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gasoperating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billiondlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue. Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization ofDome\'s offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea alsocontributed to the decline, it said. Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985. Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs. Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintainedat prior year\'s levels through new drilling activity andimprovements in productivity. Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result oflower domestic and export sales, it said. Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year. Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a dayfrom 591.0 mcf a day.

Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or2.60 dlrs per share. Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted bydelays in the receipt of a California Public UtilitiesCommission decision on the company\'s 1984 application for raterelief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructingunits one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project. It said the commission is currently allowing the company torecover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants. As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each monthas deferred non-cash account receivable, which has beenincluded in current income.

It also said the commission is now awaiting its PublicStaff Division\'s report which will recommend how much of the5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed torecover in rates.

{0 'The surge in currency futures sinceFriday on the heels of the Reagan administration\'s proposedtariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in thecoming week, financial analysts said. \"The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect itto last a little longer,\" said Craig Sloane, a currency analystwith Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co. Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of somemomentum today, is likely to continue, he said. Central banks are likely to play a role in halting theadvance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said,even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against theJapanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention. Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s comments that the G-6nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with hisrefusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a noteof stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Hornersaid G-6 central banks haven\'t yet shown the full force oftheir commitment to the Paris accord. \"I\'m among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind thescenes,\" Horner said. Horner said more forceful central bank intervention willfirm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures. \"Coordinated, punishing intervention\" by the central banks-- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which hasonly smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according toHorner. \"I think we\'re near the top of the range in the Europeans(currencies),\" he said. On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, whichset a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract,is at 0.007050, Horner said. Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet topeak. \"The basic trend in the currencies is higher,\" said AnneParker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman BrothersInc. \"The market wants to take the dollar lower.\" Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over aG-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund could make for choppy priceactivity the remainder of the week, Mills said. In addition, although the market shrugged off relativelyhealthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators andfactory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger rolein coming sessions, the analysts said. Friday\'s employment statistics in particular will beclosely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar. Reuter',1 MONEY-FX}

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend toplant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted lastyear, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln. The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels ofsoybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushelsof wheat, all below trade guesses. Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analystwith AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Tradepanel to discuss the reports. Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendlyfor the market, and soybean prices would jump three to fivecents a bushel \"if the bell rang right now.\" \"We\'re getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn andsoybeans) than we thought we had,\" he said, noting that hog andpoultry production is up. \"We\'re seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,\"said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and15 pct in the preceding quarter. However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceedconsumption. She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres camein southeastern states, where yields are usually low. \"We have the potential for record breaking soybean yieldsthis year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow\'sopening,\" she said.

{0 'Quarter-point prime rate increases to7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will befollowed by other banks only after they see clearer signs ofthe Federal Reserve\'s policy intentions, economists said. \"Based on the spread between banks\' cost of funds and theprime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, butno rush is likely,\" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co. Citibank\'s surprise base rate increase, quickly followed byChase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher. McCulley said that once the spread between three-monthcertificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a primerate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently. However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until theysee what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the nearterm, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like tofollow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when bankslifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discountrate increase in April of that year. Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate sincelast August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pctshortly after the Fed\'s half-point discount rate cut to thecurrent 5-1/2 pct level on August 20. \"The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. Thereshould be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G.Lanston and Co. Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today\'smeeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed maywell foster higher interest rates soon. Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policychange today, it may have decided to apply slight upward ratepressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heatup or the economy shows sign of strong recovery. \"The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend totighten policy when they did today\'s coupon pass,\" said JosephLiro of S.G. Warburg and Co. In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, theFed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system byoffering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds forits own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a \"pass.\" \"The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policychange,\" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean WitterReynolds Inc. She said the spread between banks\' cost of funds and theprime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is notreally narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rateincrease. The Dean Witter economist said that today\'s prime rate rise\"may have been less a response to interest rates than anattempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.\" Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans todeveloping countries, large money center banks with heavyexposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate inan effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans. The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight moneyto one another could help determine how many banks match thehigher prime rate and also how quickly they move. In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost offunds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federalfunds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds. The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflectingdemand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and theclose of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between fiveand 6-3/4 pct. Once the special distortions end, analysts said the fundsrate probably will return to its recent trading level in the6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,banks may not quickly boost their prime rates. But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to manythat the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates tohelp the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly. Reuter',1 INTEREST}

{0 'First City Bancorp of Texas, which losta record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report itexpected operating losses to continue \"for the foreseeablefuture\" as it continues to search for additional capital or amerger partner. The Houston-based bank\'s 1986 financial statements receiveda qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.The auditors said their opinion was subject to First Cityeventually obtaining additional capital. \"The company believes that in order to address itslong-term needs and return to a satisfactory level ofoperations, it will ultimately need several hundred milliondollars of additional capital, or a combination with a morestrongly capitalized entity,\" First City said in a note to itsfinancial statements included in the annual report. \"Management believes that sufficient resources should beavailable to cover interim capital concerns while additionalcapital is being sought,\" the bank said. To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sellor mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributionsto its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some ofits member banks. \"The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially lessthan in 1986,\" First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letterincluded in the annual report. \"However, the ultimate return tosatisfactory operating conditions is dependent on thesuccessful resolution of the related problems of creditquality, funding and the eventual need for substantialadditional capital.\" First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of acredit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most ofFirst City\'s excess cash to be applied to debt repayments wouldbe modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoiddefault. The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenantslast year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks. Although the parent company\'s capital adequacy ratiosexceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. FirstCity National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio. Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estateprices, First City\'s net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrslast year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more thandoubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of1986. First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its totalenergy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billiondlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs \"shouldbe more modest.\" The amount represented 15 pct of First City\'stotal loans. In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assetsnearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or ninepct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amountcould go higher. \"The company still faces uncertainties in the real estatemarket and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolioso long as the regional recession persists,\" First City said.\"Because the carrying value of many of these loans iscollateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value ofthe collateral base could cause an increase in the level ofreal estate-related chargeoffs.\" Reuter',1 EARN}
{0 'The complex task of wielding controlover monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving globaleconomy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, thenewest member of the Federal Reserve Board says. Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in themaking of monetary policy. But they would be given a muchgreater role under an idea being floated by Governor RobertHeller, who joined the board last August. He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, butargues that such an arrangement, particularly if it wereadopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce thevolatility of exchange rates. Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices ofcommodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation. His idea, which many conservative economists findappealing, has some backing among board members appointed inrecent years by President Reagan. It would complement the present system of opening orclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall ofthe money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead tochanges in interest rates and affect economic activitydirectly. Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity conceptis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetarypolicy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solidbase. \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that canserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetarypurposes,\" says Heller. In the past, this anchor was gold but the United Stateswent off the gold standard because the global economy hadvastly outstripped gold supplies. A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out ofhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largestproducers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa. The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world. But the current system of floating currencies in whichcurrencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to themonetary system, is also being widely questioned. Some have suggested that the system might benefit from aformal approach that mandates intervention by countries whencurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there aremajor problems with this also. For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countriesmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might bedetrimental to their own domestic economy. Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention canmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agreewith the fundamental judgement. The poorest countries have called for a monetary conferenceto work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps themcope with their overpowering debt problems. Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration\'schief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-calledGroup of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as aforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and othereconomic matters. He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behindclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from publicposturing. The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have aprofound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices andinternational exchange rates. As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 majorcommodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put togetherand prices would be measured on a regular basis. \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy mightbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montarypolicy might be eased,\" he says. He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auctionmarkets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on avirtually continuous basis. Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed andtraded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevancefor the entire world,\" he says. In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of theproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually allproduction processes. \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitiveindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,the monetary authorities may take such an index into account inmaking their monetary policy decisions,\" he says. However, he says that any major change in a basic commoditysuch as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action bythe OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system. He says the worst thing that could happen is to allowmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodityto the rest of the system and to other commodities. Reuter',1 MONEY-FX}

The company said the tender offer is the first step in aplan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares. Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remainingPurolator share outstanding. On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a shareleveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF HuttonLBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc. Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open mergerdiscussions with Purolator before the company accepted themanagement-led buyout offer. In a letter to Purolator\'s chairman, Nicholas F. Brady,Emery\'s chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would stillprefer to negotiate with Purolator.

Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST onApril 28, unless extended. The company said conditions of the offer include thereceipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator\'s sharesoutstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of itsshare purchase rights plan. Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of thepreviously announced sale of Purolator\'s Canadian operations. Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan GuarantyTrust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing forthe tender offer. It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued inthe subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate,payable twice a year. For the first three years after the notes are issued,interest will be paid, at Emery\'s option, in cash or inadditional notes, Emery said. It added that the notes will not be subject to redemptionfor one year after they are issued. Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unitof the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator\'smanagement would continue with the company. \"We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fitwith each other and that the combination will enable each of usto better serve our existing customers and meet the challengesof the future,\" Emery\'s chairman said in his letter. He said a merger would significantly enhance the financialturnaround that Purolator\'s management had previously forecast. Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached forcomment on the offer, which was released several hours afterthe stock market had closed. Emery\'s stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.

{0 '\"If we go on using upfarmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in20 years to grow grain on.\" Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village onthe edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as ittries to feed its more than one billion people and at the sametime let them get richer by building factories and new homes. China has to feed one quarter of the world\'s population,but only one seventh of its land is arable. Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China intoa net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in1986. But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside whichhas occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land forfactories and homes for peasants who can now afford them. Official figures show that China lost just under one pct ofits arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smalleramount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed duringthe two years. \"We lost very little land prior to 1980 when theindustrialisation began,\" official Xu said. \"Since then, nearlyall the families in the county have built new homes and manyfactories have gone up.\" \"Last year we lost land to a new railway line,\" Xu said. Butland losses in future should fall because nearly all familiesalready have new houses, she added. The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to thePeking leadership, which announced earlier this month thatChina will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain landfor the first time this year. \"The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,\" saidan article in the official press explaining the new measures. \"It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,\" itsaid. \"China has a large population and its land resources arebadly deficient.\" An official of the Shanghai city government said countyauthorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares ofarable land to other uses, while anything more than that mustbe approved by the city government. The Peking government faces another major obstacle in itsefforts to ensure China\'s people get enough grain to eat. Theprices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, makingit more profitable for them to grow other crops. To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliserand diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts tobuy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices toChina\'s 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidisegrain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it. Some officials argue that the simplest solution to theproblem would be for the state to raise city grain prices. Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in theeastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened toomuch to the demands of \"selfish city people\" and could raise citygrain prices without any problem. But the government has ruled out a price rise. \"Raising theprice of grain would directly conflict with the goal of socialstability,\" said a China Daily editorial this month. The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over thelong term. \"We must be very careful. We have a very largepopulation which is used to price stability and will object toprice rises,\" he said. \"The problem is how to do it.\" The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices mightalso affect the prices of hundreds of food products made withgrain and consumed by city residents. In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequateinvestment by farmers in land and in grain in particular. The official press has reported that farmers fear farmpolicy may change and they are putting their new wealth intobuilding graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes. Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers signcontracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land. \"As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost atthe halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about thefuture,\" the China Daily said in an editorial last month. Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed touse the land but not own it. For most of the period ofCommunist rule, the land was organised into collectives wherethere was little room for individual initiative. \"New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistencyof government policies and make them interested in long-terminvestment,\" the newspaper said.

{0 'The grain output of a major Chinesegrain-producing province is not increasing, because farmerslack incentives, production costs are rising, storagefacilities are poor and there is not enough state investment ingrain, the province\'s vice-governor said. The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton asthey could growing grain, and three times as much growing cashcrops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pctof farmers\' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investmenthad caused the area of irrigated land to fall. Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pctof the province\'s total investment, from 26 pct in 1978. He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain washit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and afurther 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats. He said government measures to deal with the problem dealtwith trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for moreinvestment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal useof or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called thetendency to rely on grain imports.

{0 'Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> managementboard chairman Walter Seipp said that from the presentviewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to belower than in 1986. In the first two months of the year, partial operatingprofit -- excluding trading on the bank\'s own account -declined, he said, without giving details. The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of thequiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly.By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased. German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seippsaid last year the figure for the first time had topped onebillion marks for the parent bank, and the group result wasaround 50 pct higher than this. Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, \"we were able to raise thefull operating profit...Slightly above the record result of1985 because own account profits increased slightly.\" He gave no concrete details but added that in January andFebruary, good own account trading profits meant that the dropin full operating earnings was more modest than that in thepartial operating figure. The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented infuture, developing, for example, more into investment banking,keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampeningexpenditures on fixed assets. Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there hadbeen a strong growth in business volume. Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added. Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15billion. It would have been around five billion marks higherstill if currency relationships had remained unchanged. In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct inthe year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985\'s 2.56pct despite pressure on credit rates. The surplus on commission business, which had soared by aquarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almostexclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said. Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at morethan 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pctto more than 650 mln. As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit roseby 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks. Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last yearfrom 233 mln in 1985. Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a \"hightwo-figure million\" in profit from the sale of the bank\'s AEG AG<AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F> during the latter\'smajority stake purchase booked last year. The ability of the bank to write off depreciations incredit business against profits from securities trading andearnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prioryears, to its full extent. Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far thelargest part of the provisions were set aside for individualwrite-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle ofproblem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio ofcredit exposure to provisions improved further. Seipp said that because about half the group\'s exposure toproblem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped intodollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks. \"This means that no open currency positions exist any longeron the amount of the provision that is made against an actualdefault,\" he added. Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in thelast few weeks, he said, the international banking community isbetter armed than it was against payment problems. All banks had significantly strengthened their capitalbase, most European banks had made considerable provisionsagainst bad debts while goverments and central banks werebetter prepared for unforseen difficulties. He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting newapproach to indebted nations\' problems. There was a lot ofinterest in direct investment via an equity participation inLatin America, particularly from West German firms. Reuter',1 EARN}

{0 'A proposed sales tax on gold transactionscould put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift oftrading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president andTokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a pressconference. \"If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,\"he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese wouldbe unable to compete in the international market, he added. \"How can the government really raise taxes if the systemthey impose is prohibitive of generating business?\" he said. The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical tradesexceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yentax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said. The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies tradingmore than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well asthat of jewellery and coins, dealers said. However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery andcoins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said. Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct goldturnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986. A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banksfell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said. Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of thevolume prior to imposition of the tax, he said. While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, thevolume of trades outside the country, particularly in Londonand Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said. Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly averagejust under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said. Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but thegovernment had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins tocommemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito\'s reign, dealerssaid. Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanesetrading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreignparticipant. Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between oneand 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, whilefutures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealerssaid. \"All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyomarket is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the threemajor financial markets in the world ... And in my personalopinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damperon this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,\"Hofer said. \"I don\'t think it fits the philosophy of aninternationalising market,\" he added.

{0 'The Indian Finance Ministry\'sannouncement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation\'sinterest rate structure, will benefit industry and agricultureby providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said. The changes, effective today, included reducing commercialbank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pctby one percentage point. New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, alsoinclude a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, ondeposits of two years or more but less than five. Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pctinterest have been abolished. Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect thegovernment\'s concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and helpimprove world competitiveness of Indian goods. There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank depositsby long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will createthe flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equityshares or short-term bank deposits, they said. A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs dueto lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market. Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday\'s closingof 1,012.50 rupees. A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic nowto buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because theFinance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively. \"But overall debenture prospects remain bright because therates of interest on them will still be higher than what bankspay for deposits of similar maturity,\" a merchant banker said.

Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in Januarythe cabinet would decide on Malaysia\'s participation, but sofar a decision has not been announced. The government is saidto be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growersand traders told Reuters they are against the idea becausecertain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage. Malaysia is the world\'s fourth largest cocoa producer. Thegovernment feels that the pact, through its buffer stockmechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which islabouring under surpluses, officials said. But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia\'sparticipation in the pact will require them to pay a levy forexports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA. They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne atcurrent prices and said they are not prepared to accept itbecause a big portion of Malaysia\'s cocoa exports, officiallyestimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members. Most growers and traders added they are also against abuffer stock measure under the agreement which requireswithholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump. Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year,might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and thismight affect their economic viability, they said. \"The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and itwill be a real messy business for the government and the tradeif it ever occurs,\" an industry source said. The growers and traders also said that under new bufferstock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is nota member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is alsoallowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile. Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such asMalaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock. Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers tojoin the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it neednot rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countriesto join the agreement even at a later date.

{0 'The prospect that other banks willfollow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raisingtheir prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the creditmarkets today, economists said. Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two daysof heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market byannouncing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed. Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar- the market\'s overriding concern of late - rose sharply on thenews. Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in theEuromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate. Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fearsof a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, buteconomists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whosepolicy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets thisweek, is already tightening its grip on credit. \"The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting thebanking system\'s reserve needs this statement period, but Iwouldn\'t conclude anything until I\'ve seen the Fed data,\" saidJeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

{0 'U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra DayO\'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunctionblocking the planned merger of Delta <DAL> AirlinesInc and Western Airlines <WAL>, the Court said. O\'Connor\'s action came hours after a three-judge panel ofthe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco hadblocked the merger until a dispute over union representationhad been settled by arbitration. A Supreme Court spokesman said O\'Connor granted a stay ofthe injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,to go through as planned later today. The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Eachof the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over aparticular regional Appellate circuit and has the power toprovisionally overturn its rulings without comment. The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials ofAtlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the mergerfor months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanesbelonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles. \"Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,\"Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution latelast night. \"There was really very little that remained to bedone.\" The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had beenfiled in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air TransportEmployees union sought to force Western\'s management to fulfilla promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger tookplace. The airlines argued that Western\'s promise could not beenforced in a takeover by a larger company. After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officialslast night spread the word by telephone that Western employeesshould report for work today in their old uniforms, not in newDelta outfits. Delta announced last September that it was purchasingWestern. The merger took place in December, and Western hasbeen operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Westernname was to have disappeared at midnight last night. At issue is whether the Western unions would continue torepresent Western employees after the integration of the twoairlines. While all but eight pct of Western\'s 11,000 employees areunionized, only Delta\'s pilots are union members. Delta had maintained that the three unions having contractswith Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and theTeamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be\"extinguished\" after today.

University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,\"Thereport shows that hog producers have responded to a verydesirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10months.\" Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futuresprices are above producers\' break even points. Even if futuresfell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could stilllock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavyselling pressure today. \"We have not had a period of profitability of thismagnitude since last summer,\" Levitt said. \"In fact, hogoperations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have beenso profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get backon their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hogoperation alone.\" Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also wasnegative, in that some lead time was anticipated before theslaughter increased from the previous year. We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but wedidn\'t expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-statespring report, Levitt added. High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn thatcould be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increasedprofits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations toincrease production starting late last year. Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hogherd resulted from a revision of the December report andwithout the revision, the March report might have been veryclose to average expectations.

Discounts in the October and December contracts take intoconsideration a six to seven pct increase in March/Mayfarrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1report, Fuller said. Grimes said, \"As far as the distant months are concerned,if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take atremendous discount in price for each percent increase for usto push down to the prices that the current futures show forthe July and August period.\" Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted thatdistant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower thanthey were last summer. \"If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrsduring July, that doesn\'t mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaperthis year because we have six pct more numbers,\" he said.
