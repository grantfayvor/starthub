{0 'The U.S. Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal todrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growersfor the cut with targeted income payments. In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanyingthe \"Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987\", Peter Myers,Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administrationwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginningwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now. Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by thegovernment for the price support cut with targeted incomepayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments wouldcost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said. The administration sugar proposal is expected to beintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.John Porter, R-Ill. Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic itis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate becausepolitically-influential sugar and corn growersand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist. The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and graduallylowers payments over four years. It also excludes from paymentany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower. For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a growerwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991. The income payments would be based on the amount ofcommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said. Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changesin the sugar program because the current high price support iscausing adverse trends in the sugar industry. He said the current program has artificially stimulateddomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowedcorn sweeteners to make market inroads. U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a\"progressive contraction\" of the sugar import quota to only onemln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugarrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing. Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program givesoverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products acompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports ofsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processingfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar. USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost onU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA saidconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more thannecessary for sugar. \"Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap betweensweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverseimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currentlyfacing,\" Myers said.

{0 'The St. Lawrence Seaway, setto reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough yearbecause of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of thefirst strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officialssaid. Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modesof transportation are all expected to result in only a marginalincrease over last year\'s traffic levels -- and revenues -- onthe 2,300 mile waterway, officials said. In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, theseaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montrealand Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal,linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveledthrough the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln throughthe eight-lock canal. The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrsthis year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executivemember of Canada\'s St Lawrence Seaway Authority. The seaway moves about one-half of Canada\'s exported grain.Those exports of the single most important commodity carried onthe waterway have been depressed by world surpluses. The Seafarers\' International Union, which represents about2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has saidit will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers\'demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions. \"It\'s 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike,\" RomanGralewicz, head of the Seafarers\' Canadian branch, has said. The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliatorto try to hammer out a contract agreement between the twosides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships onthe Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic. \"We haven\'t had a strike on the seaway for years...aprolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,\" SeawayAuthority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said. \"These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of theSt Lawrence Seaway,\" George Miller, vice-president of theCanadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of majorCanadian shipping companies, said recently. The workers\' current contract expires May 31. Theassociation said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wagesfor the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power torestructure crew dispatching. The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic andfreight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985was its worst year in two decades. Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls onthe Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to lastyear\'s 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tollsthroughout the rest of the waterway. Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway\'s 15 locks andabout 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs. \"We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but wewon\'t see a major increase for a number of years,\" Hemsley said. A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippersin Western Europe should result in some increased traffic thisseason but the full benefits won\'t be felt for several years,Blair said.

{0 'Trade is the most urgent problemfacing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need toreach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark,Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said. Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting formore than a year in an effort to work out an agreement. \"The most urgent problem now is the trade question becausethat has to be decided within the next 10 months,\" Clark toldthe Commonwealth Club of California. \"We have a fast trackauthority from your Congress for approval or rejection ofwhatever the negotiators achieve.\" Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initialagreement must be reached by late September or early October. He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain,and defense as the second and third most important bilateralissues facing Ottawa and Washington. On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rainproblem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture inadvance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, withPrime Minister Brian Mulroney. In a question-and-answer session with the public affairsgroup, Clark said that the two countries must find bettermechanisms for resolving their trade disputes. \"This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted oncorn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they werequasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in placenow are not working adequately in either of our interests,\" hesaid. Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington\'s ruleson government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, hesaid. \"There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order tosecure substantial contracts in the United States, have had tomove their head offices out of our country into your countrybecause you have national procurement requirements,\" he said. In turn, he added, the United States would like to changesome of the procurement requirements that exist at theprovincial government level in Canada. Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions. \"What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, inthe first instance, to propose, and then governments andcongresses will have judge,\" he said. In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United Stateshas tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports toits northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan.\"Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last yearthan you bought from Canada,\" he said.

{0 'Higher crude oil prices will raisedemand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lostto heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said. The analysts said that these efforts will be mostsuccessful in the industrial sectors of the economy with largeand growing energy requirements. \"Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share ofoil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residualfuel industry last year,\" Michael Smolinski, an energyeconomist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters. An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel wentinto the utilities market at the expense of natural gas lastyear when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said. Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, nationalaverage gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at AmericanGas Association said. The average delivered prices at the end of January were2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago. \"We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubicfeet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second andthird quarter (1987),\" he said. In addition to price competitiveness, availability will bean important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.in New York noted. Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the NorthAmerican continent has led to a build up of gas inventories andless would be necessary to replenish underground storage thisspring freeing gas for spot sales. These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fearsthat natural gas suplies would be tight and pricessignificantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling lastyear. AGA\'s German contended that despite the drilling decline,much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to productionquickly through developments such as the infill drilling whichpermits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.

{0 'The United States will likely imposesanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators saidtoday after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige. Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decisionwould be taken until a final determination is made on whetherJapanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they saidthey were virtually sure Japan would face penalties. President Reagan\'s trade policy advisory group, of whichBaldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday. \"I am confident we will see action taken,\" Sen. John McCain,an Arizona Republican, told reporters. \"I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more thansanctions,\" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said. The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductorindustry representatives met with Baldrige and State Departmentofficials to discuss Japan\'s alleged violations of a September1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the UnitedStates and other countries. They recommended Japanese firms be penalized throughtariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months forcontinuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said. Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen.Pete Wilson told reporters, \"The clear import of what he said isthat there will be.\" \"Japan can\'t just say they will comply. We think sanctionsmust be applied,\" for past violations of the agreement, theCalifornia Republican said. The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chipswhich are used in high technology products ranging from radiosto defence missile guidance systems. Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige toldthem the administration had not made a final determination thatJapanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips belowthe cost of production in the United States or other countries. But McClure said senators told him, \"There is no doubtdumping is going on,\" based on evidence such as invoices ofpurchases of the Japanese products. The two countries signed a pact last September in whichJapan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the UnitedStates and other countries below production costs and to allowthe U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market. In return, the United States waived its right to imposeimport duties on the Japanese microchips. Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pactand have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output tosave the pact. Japan has frequently been the target of congressionaldiscouragement over last year\'s record 169-billion-dlr tradedeficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the UnitedStates last year and had large surpluses with other countries. The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolutioncalling for action against Japan for violations of the pactsince September. The resolution will be introduced in the Housenext week by Rep.

{0 'Bolivia, once Latin America\'s mostdelinquent debtor, is preparing for a second InternationalMonetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation programhas effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending. A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Pazshortly to discuss terms of the new agreement. He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mlndlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends thismonth. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatoryfinancing facility and a structural adjustment facility. The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over thenext 12 months. Bolivia\'s agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the ParisClub and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs ofBolivia\'s 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt. Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters thenegotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to befinalised, had been extremely successful. Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to rescheduleBolivia\'s debt over 10 years with five to six years grace andhad waived all interest payments until the end of 1988. Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said. Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs indisbursements this year from lender countries and internationalagencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources putthe figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs. Nogales said Bolivia\'s net international reserves arearound 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President IctorPaz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said thecapital flow on Bolivia\'s debt servicing versus new credits hadchanged from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a netinflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986. Bolivia\'s return from the financial wilderness follows pazestenssoro\'s economic stabilisation program. He inheritedinflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that werelosing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded onthe black market at up to 16 times its official rate. Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market-related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid offthousands of workers in state corporations. Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the pastsix months, according to the Central Bank, and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pctcontraction over the last six years. The government is also proposing a novel solution to itsdebt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interesthas not been paid since March, 1984. Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia wouldmake a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt atthe price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia\'s commercial banksteering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to considerthe proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of thecountry\'s creditor banks will take up the offer. One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able tobuy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under thedeal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loansto the country. But he said the larger creditors were more interested in ascheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operatedin Chile for the past two years. The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals fordebt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning toprivatise more than 100 state companies and these could serveas a basis for such a scheme. Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might proveattractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as thegovernment realises that it will have to attract a large amountof new capital in order to grow. Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reutersthat Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in newinvestment over the next 10 to 12 years. The government realises that in order to remain viable,Bolivia will need to develop new exports. The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct ofBolivia\'s exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets,and gas, the country\'s major revenue earner, is in abundantsupply in the region.

{0 'The new International Natural RubberAgreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stockas the sole instrument for market intervention -- excludingexport quotas or production controls. The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held underthe auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD). In many respects the main features in the new pact resemblethose contained in the present one. The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singaporects per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now andOctober 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of thedaily market indicator price remains above the upperintervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lowerintervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months. If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikelyconsidering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts-- the price would be revised under the current accord by fivepct or by whatever amount the International Natural RubberCouncil decides. The new reference price would then be taken over for thenew agreement. Under the same circumstances in the new pact the referenceprice would be automatically revised by five pct unless theCouncil decides on a higher percentage. Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, thereference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unlessthe Council decides on a higher percentage. Another change introduced in the new INRA is that pricereviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18. Those changes are intended to make the reference price moreresponsive to market trends. As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levelsare set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the\"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it. The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceilingprices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless theCouncil decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months. During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposalthat the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is thesame as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provisionfor an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes. Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will bebrought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price. At last Friday\'s session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking forproducers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pacthad served the purpose for which it had been created. Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers,agreed that the current agreement had worked \"relatively well.\" Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA,delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accordhad maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level. They said the agreement until now did not appear to haveencouraged excessive production of rubber. In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the bufferstock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. \"It is asort of middle-of-the-road agreement,\" one delegate said. The new pact will be open for signature at U.N.Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year. To become operational, it will require ratification bycountries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct ofworld imports. Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months fromnow. During the hiatus between the two agreements, theInternational Natural Rubber Council will remain in place.

The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82. A ministry official attributed the decline to fallingproduction of non-metal products, textiles and transportationequipment, and less mining and house construction. The official said the decline was also caused by fallingexports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar,which has made Taiwanese products more expensive. He expected the decline to continue in the next few monthsbecause of further appreciation of the local dollar against theU.S. Currency. The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against theU.S. Dollar since September 1985. It closed at 34.40 to theU.S. Dollar today, and is expected to rise to about 32 to thedollar by the end of this year, foreign bankers and economistssaid. REUTER',1 IPI}

{0 'World Bank President Barber Conable isexpected to press Indonesia, the Third World\'s sixth largestdebtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes totackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, willmeet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia\'slargest nation was being managed well, but the slump in worldoil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projectsin the eastern section of Java, Indonesia\'s most populousisland. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detaileddiscussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severelyhit by last year\'s crash in oil prices, which cut its oil andgas revenues in half. Japan\'s state Export-Import Bank last month agreed toprovide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesiapay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded tothe oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans tobridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suhartoand leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policychange, particularly in dismantling Indonesia\'s high-costprotected economy. \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all callfor major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable saidin his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections nextmonth, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply thatthe Bank is demanding specific changes. \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and theeconomy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters atJakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it theThird World\'s sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he wouldlike to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changesalready introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of thegovernment\'s trade reform measures, and supported itsdetermination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since lastMay to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourageoutside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to lookinto which of Indonesia\'s 215 state-run companies could besold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said thegovernment appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government isunsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia\'s high-costmonopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week thatIndonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because thiswould increase the balance of payments deficit and domesticinflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outsidethe oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia\'s current account deficit is projected by thegovernment to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financialyear which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in1986/87.

{0 'Nigeria\'s Central Bank has changed therules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analystssee as a means of defending the naira currency, which hasdepreciated steadily. The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banksbidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate theyoffered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowestsuccessful bid made at the auction. This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensurethat they were successful while paying the lower \"marginal\" rate,analysts said. \"It should act as a brake because banks will know that ifthey bid high they will have to pay what they offered,\" aWestern diplomat commented. The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pctsince the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign ExchangeMarket (SFEM), began last September 26. At last week\'s session the Nigerian currency was fixed at4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row. \"They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way oftrying to stop the trend,\" the diplomat said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would befortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2. It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday\'sscheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank wasplanning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offerat each auction. Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstrippedsupply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus furtherweakening the naira. If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at thefortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objectiveof the new system, analysts said. Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, theofficial exchange rate for the naira applying to businesstransactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- thelowest successful bid. SFEM is a central part of Nigeria\'s structural adjustmentprogram, which is considered to be the most ambitious economicrecovery plan in Black Africa. The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate forthe naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalisingimports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducinginefficient government participation in the economy. The World Bank has played a prominent part in designingthis dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an oftensceptical public which fears inflation and lower livingstandards. Ishrat Husain, the World Bank\'s representative in Nigeria,said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustmentprogram as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions. \"So far so good\" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos,adding that only members of Nigeria\'s import-dependent elitewould suffer hardship while the common man would benefit. Fears that the program would encourage inflation wereincorrect, he said. Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urbanprices had already reflected the naira\'s black market valuebefore the currency was allowed to find its true level lastSeptember.

The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to havebeen particularly successful, with northern hemispherecountries managing to have service industries such as bankingand insurance included in the next full round. The southerners\' goal of including agricultural andtropical products also was met. The meeting at this North Island tourist resort isdescribed by participants as informal and no declaration isexpected. Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of politicalurgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\" Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade topeople who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see thebenefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontationwhile we proceed with orderly negotiations.\" The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegationsincluding representatives of GATT and the Economic Community. The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter. American sources say he is ready to state that the best wayto reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is toimplement four key Uruguay proposals: -- an end to agricultural subsidies; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATTregulations; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-calledintellectual property such as trademarks, patents andcopyrights; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT\'s 92member states.

{0 'A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasurysupply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering creditmarket, but at least this week\'s offerings should provide itwith some focus, economists said. \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put towork, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\"said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package oftwo-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales blockthis week. The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs innew cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes forauction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes onWednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes onThursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- andsix-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs. The mini-refunding does not come at a particularlyauspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been driftingsideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudyU.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change inFederal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar. Moreover, the bond market\'s inertia has comparedunfavourably with the rash of activity taking place inhigh-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.Equities. But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there aresigns the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting abit. \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,and there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weeklyreport. Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believesbanks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week\'ssales. \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying thesematurities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in aweekly market review. But economists agreed not even the auctions will generateenough impetus for a major move. This will only come once theoverseas markets have had their run. \"Based on last week\'s events, there is little to indicatethat the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economistsat Salomon Brothers Inc. Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investorsare planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of thehigher-yielding markets at the start of Japan\'s new fiscal yearon April 1. And while traditionally the Japanese have not been bigbuyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week\'s U.S.Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence. Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadianmonetary authorities to curb the rise of their currenciesshould also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bondmarkets, the Salomon Brothers\' economists said. Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven theU.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,economists said. This week\'s economic calendar begins on Tuesday withFebruary durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound fromJanuary\'s depressed levels. Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co saidseveral areas, including transport equipment, should havebounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will captotal new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct afterJanuary\'s 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gainas large as five pct. Friday\'s consumer price report for February is expected toshow an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind theJanuary rise -- rose more moderately last month, while foodprices declined. Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds ratewill be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to theapproach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date. Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass thisweek because its adding requirement increases sharply in thenew statement period beginning on Thursday.

Stocks of finished goods and raw materials fell sharply inthe March quarter and further depletion was forecast for theJune quarter, the survey said.

Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGLshare if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders. SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited. In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it wasdenied confidential information on SGL that would be given toother potential bidders. SGL officials could not be reached for comment. Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for thesale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access toSGL\'s books and records and the opportunity to talk with keyemployees. \"We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyoutfirms,\" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGLmanagement may be considering a leveraged buyout. Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on afriendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate allthe terms of its offer. Dart said SGL representatives said the company has notreceived any other offer. It said it requested the confidential information to betterunderstand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to signan agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL withoutSGL\'s approval. The agreement would also have limited its ability to buySGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditionsunreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendlytransaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meetingwith SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hoperepresentatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was toldthere were certain issues important to SGL management and whilethey were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to takethem into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mlndlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vicepresident James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers\'severance agreements, although there was an implication thatLieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of theirown volition. Dart said under their present agreements, none of theseofficers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management\'sincentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a costof six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the sharesunless waived by the company\'s compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for topmanagement\'s supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severanceobligations and future salary guarantees for top management,estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligationsunder the company\'s present policy. Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed todiscuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try tonegotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chainand Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filedby an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking suchactions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out theirfiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by anunwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue ofsecurities to shareholders which make a takeover moreexpensive. REUTER',1 ACQ}
{0 'The government\'sover-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affectingAustralia\'s economic performance, Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said. Over one-third of Australia\'s indirect tax income isderived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weakcrude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here. This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts thecountry\'s economic performance directly by acting as adisincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affectingtrading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said. Australia\'s medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiencyposition is posing a major economic threat, yet thegovernment\'s response has been to load new tax burdens on theoil industry, Benbow said. Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected tofall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of theBass Strait fields, he said. Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with thethree largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said. By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just overhalf the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undevelopedfields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery fromexisting fields goes ahead, Benbow said. Government projections of output from as yet undiscoveredfields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said. Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying acrude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five yearstime, he said. At present world oil prices and the current value of theAustralian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would costbetween 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said. Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980\'s, theaddition to reserves has been inadequate, he said. For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the fiveyears 1980-84 represent about two years\' consumption, he said.

Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulkof world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in aspeech prepared for delivery to the Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) annual conference. It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewherewill not change this fact, he said. McIvor said 37 of the world\'s 30,000 oil fields containabout 35 pct of all oil ever discovered. Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside theMiddle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in thelast 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said. He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at therate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year. More than half of remaining proved reserves are in theMiddle East, he said. McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oiloutside the Middle East because each addition contributes to adiversity of supply desirable for global political and economicstability. \"It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-countrydiscoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stabletaxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up ofacreage for exploration,\" he said.

The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discoveredbefore September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty CoLtd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-inproduction, accelerating the decline in output and reducinggovernment revenue, he said.

{0 'West German bond yields could declineover the next few months if recent efforts to stabilizeexchange rates, as seen in last month\'s Paris pact, extend tokeeping down European interest rates, banking economists said. But in the longer term domestic yields could rise underagreements to stimulate West Germany\'s economy, they said. The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilizedcurrencies with the threat of central bank intervention,economists said. Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolsterthe pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest ratesfurther when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April.\"The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbankand the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rateare significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.and foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recentstudy. It said narrowing of international interest rate spreadswas a major factor in the dollar\'s fall. These spreads willhave to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized. West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouragedthe U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when theBundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoidweakening the dollar. West German economists see room for further cuts in leadingWest German rates if the dollar resumes its decline. \"It\'s not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for CommerzbankAG said. But most economists see room for a cut in West German ratesonly in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflationwill limit room for manoeuvre later in the year. The Bundesbank\'s average yield of public paper is alreadynearing last year\'s low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April. Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors toshift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a movewould tend to flatten the yield curve between short andlong-term rates, which has become more pronounced since theBundesbank lowered its discount rate. It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, asthe shift out of savings accounts into securities would slowgrowth of the Bundesbank\'s central bank money stock aggregate. But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase WestGerman tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed tomeet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move mayforce interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which mustbe filled by higher government borrowing. This may not occur if private sector demand for creditremains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising. Economists said it appeared the government had alreadystepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss fromother sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker thanexpected economic growth, and higher than expected spending. Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West GermanIfo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by theWest German government in November. Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.But coupled with other factors such as waning foreignspeculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar\'s decline, longterm yields may to have to rise, economists said. Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing toincreases in the second phase of Bonn\'s tax reform package. The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion. West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increasedborrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable. Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday hewas looking for other ways to finance the reform, such asraising indirect taxes. But few economists believe the government will be able togo through with its tax measures without increasing netborrowing. The Bundesbank said in its February report that it waswrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986could be managed without increasing deficits. The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borroweda large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 finalquarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985. The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks ofthe fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billionmarks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when ithad not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting,said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuringthe economy, but did not elaborate. Hata said protectionist pressures in the internationaleconomy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits,payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries. Despite great potential, developing economies are stillconfronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added. The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declarationlast September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequenttrade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva. \"It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitmentto implementing that plan as scheduled,\" Hata said. Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiationsin some areas at the expense of others.

But there was extensive damage to the central part of the32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products togasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months. The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as aresult of the explosion as it will be able to bring in productfrom other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam,a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpdplant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant. He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker waskilled, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation. The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half ofits capacity since the end of January while an extensiveoverhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex wherethe hydrocracker is sited, he said. This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, butthis is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident. Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flareline at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesmansaid this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident.

Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, orat any time over the following five weeks before the officialpayment date.

But there was no reason to expect Australian production in1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year,the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales andQueensland suffered from poor yields last season.

He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of atwo-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progressmade by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting lastSeptember launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement onTariffs and Trade) talks.

The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentumtowards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.

The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (theequivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers andprocessors for coffee already delivered, but its present exportrevenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said. The board\'s cash crisis has serious implications for theeconomy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct ofUganda\'s total exports. The CMB\'s financial difficulties first started in Januaryfollowing delays in rail-freighting export consignments ofcoffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga. These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons inUganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandanwagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan andTanzanian railway systems, the sources said Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publiclyacknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears tolocal suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport formoving exports. Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeezewould be resolved in two weeks. However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies betweenthe Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it outof action between February 21 and March 15, causing freshdelays in cargo movements. Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruptionof rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has bannedtheir haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs. Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMBwas holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags. These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda\'sexpected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September)crop, the sources said. According to the sources, the board\'s financial problemshave been aggravated by long delays in processing exportreceipts. The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycleexport receipts into payments to local producers, whereasexport bills handled by local banks took half that time toprocess, they said. The sources said the CMB\'s price structure had beenovertaken by Uganda\'s high inflation rate, unofficiallyestimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a furtherdisincentive to producers, already owed large arrears. \"The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three monthsbehind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and thesooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, thebetter for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,\" oneof the sources said.

McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discoveredso far only 37 \"one-one thousandth of the total number containedabout 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.\" McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did notbelieve there were any more \"super giants\", or oil fields withreserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found whichwould change the conclusion of the world\'s growing dependency. \"Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the MiddleEast. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20years and only two of these lie outside the middle east(Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska\'s North Slope).\" McIvor said. McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S.like Alaska\'s Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching apeak and would soon begin to decline. But the Exxon executive said that there were still plentyof opportunities to be explored and developed outside of theMiddle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, andAustralia and Africa. McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in thoseareas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higherprice of oil as well as the legal regime affecting thecompanies. \"The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is aconstant change in policies,\" McIvor said. McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used toincrease exploration as these only benefit one part of theeconomy at the expense of other parts of the economy.

{0 'Japan has launched a last-ditch effort tosalvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States -sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out itscase and instructing its producers to cut output further. \"We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,\"Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) DeputyDirector General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters. \"If hasty action is taken in the United States, it willcreate very serious problems.\" The Reagan Administration\'s Economic Policy is expected tomeet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateralagreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreedto stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and toincrease its imports of American semiconductors. Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal byselling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boostAmerican imports, and has threatened to take retaliatoryaction. In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanesechip makers to limit production in the hope that will boostdomestic demand and reduce the incentive to export. Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobitdynamic random access and erasable programmable read onlymemory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows acutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of theyear. He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply ofchips available for export through unregulated distributors inthe so-called grey market. \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply isdiminishing.\" To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITIcalled in the president of Japan\'s largest semiconductor maker,NEC Corp <NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuingspecific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiaryof <Texas Instruments Inc>. Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out thesteps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed forU.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers. The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State GeorgeSchultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, areexpected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip makerMicron Technology Inc <DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales inHong Kong. Yamamoto admitted that <Oki Electric Industry Co>\'s HongKong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level butdenied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices. \"If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...Wewill present our rebuttal,\" he said. The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI\'sadvice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well aboveproduction costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said. He also called the case \"strange,\" but he stopped short ofendorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had beentrapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micronpublicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same daythey were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person whohad bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

{0 'Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, todaylodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented itspetition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC. The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22,when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimedby banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of thecollapse of the ITC\'s buffer stock operations in October 1985.AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal. The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred onthree points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head ofthe broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters. The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction towind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an associationwithin the meaning of the Companies Act, and that thewinding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of anarbitration award. AMT will contest all three points. The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of thewinding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT willargue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnoldsaid. The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of anarbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that thecourt accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move toenforce an arbitration ruling. The court originally decided that the winding-up petitionwent wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMTspokesman said. The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, buta case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to beheard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have areceiver appointed over the ITC\'s assets. Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it ispossible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could beconsolidated with AMT\'s appeal, Arnold said. Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against theCouncil\'s member states and an application by the governmentsto strike out the first of these, brought by J.H.

{0 'Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy\'sInternational Inc\'s stock, even after Coca Cola Co took thefizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interestedsuitor. Wendy\'s retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and losta point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue.However, Wendy\'s remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of morethan three mln shares. Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet theysaid they could not conclude a takeover of the fast foodrestaurant chain was impossible. Wendy\'s declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.Yet, a Wendy\'s spokesman said the company was aware of aBusiness Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitorand which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill. Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> andPepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neitherof those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy\'sofficial. \"It doesn\'t happen every day, every week, every month, butits not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,\" saidDenny Lynch, Wendy\'s vice president of communications. However, Lynch would not comment specifically on thecurrent market rumors. Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had beenskeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated itviews fast food chains as customers and does not want to becomea competitor to them. \"I can\'t put another name on it,\" said Kidder peabodyanalyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold upWendy\'s stock. \"It very well could be someone\'s interested.\" But Freedman said he doesn\'t believe now is the right timefor Wendy\'s to be sold. \"They\'re obviously having operational difficulties. I\'vealways believed at the right price Wendy\'s would consider (anoffer), but I can\'t believe this is the right price at theright time,\" Freedman said. \"If a transaction takes place, the buyer\'s going to controlthe situation,\" Freedman said. \"I just don\'t think there\'s anything going on. I don\'tthink it\'s worth much more than where it is,\" said Joseph Doyleof Smith Barney. Analysts said Wendy\'s has suffered largely from the \"burgerwars\" between itself, McDonald\'s Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co\'s<PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy\'s, the third largest fast foodhamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same storesales last year, analysts said. Wendy\'s also fumbled when it introduced a high-pricedbreakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Someanalysts said the company should be bringing in new products,but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround. There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy\'s may bevulnerable to a takeover. James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy\'s could be worth14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company hasimproved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy\'s owns a highpercent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500. \"They also have some attractive leaseholds on theirrestaurants,\" Murren said. Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,Wendy\'s real sales, store for store, turned upwards in thefourth quarter. \"That was about the first time in sevenquarters,\" he said. Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something couldbe going on with Wendy\'s. \"My gut feeling is something\'s goingto happen. I don\'t know what,\" she said. She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrsper share. One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitorbecause Wendy\'s decided to sell Coke at its fountains insteadof Pepsi. Wendy\'s is currently embroiled in litigation brought byPepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.Pepsi\'s soda is still sold in the Wendy\'s restaurants. Reuter',1 ACQ}

{0 'International Business Machines Corp,hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back bythe end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst RickMartin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said. \"There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit notuntil later this year,\" Martin said at a technology conferencesponsored by the investment firm. Martin said the coming rebound reflects new productintroductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drasticimprovement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending. IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs inmid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at149-1/2 dlrs. Analysts, computer industry executives, and the companyitself, have highlighted the external economic factorshampering IBM\'s growth. But Martin said the product cycle was key to understandingthe rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, andpointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view.\"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,\" he saidof DEC\'s line of VAX computers. In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatiblemid-range product line. A new computer code-named \"Fort Knox\"was supposed to tie together a number of IBM\'s mid-rangesystems, but the product never got off the ground, he said. Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into theIBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects shouldbe unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. \"The major story will be arebound in its mid-range business.\" He said sales of IBM\'s mid-range computers fell about 13pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growthin mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988. High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are comingto the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5pct in the midst of IBM\'s sharply lower 1986 year, growth willdrop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said. By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martinsaid. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of51.3 billion dlrs. Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earningsand stock have been propelled by a strong slew of productintroductions in the mid-range area. In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat toDEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies werecatering largely to existing customer bases, rather thanstealing market share from one another.

The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but saidcolumns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iraniantanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlierGulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today\'ssupertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported byBaghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, whenthe Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran\'s offshore oilfields atNowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50miles) west of Kharg island, today\'s communique said. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthymarket,\" Melamed told Reuters in an interview. \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with afour pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currencyfluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is tomake each contract a larger value.\" As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumentalin the development of currency futures, which now are crucialto the Chicago exchange. Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated canapproach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts bygovernments to control currency fluctuations. \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, anhour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it\'sunrealistic and it doesn\'t work and it\'s unnecessary.\" The CME\'s top policymaker also said a decision by theexchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stockindex futures contract to the morning from the afternoon wouldhelp eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equitymarkets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day. \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have asalutary effect so that over a longer period of time I thinkthis issue (triple witching) will go away because of the changein the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled togo into effect, he said. Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by tradersof the popular Standard and Poor\'s 500 stock index future wouldaddress complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading. Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barringbrokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their ownaccount. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged indual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades tothe nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups. The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effecton the marketplace. That\'s going to prove very, veryinstrumental in increasing volume over time,\" he said,predicting the increase would come within a year. Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, saidthe CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limiton the S and P 500 index\'s daily price movement when theCommodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it couldnot be a temporary program.

{0 'US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone ventureof GTE Corp <GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc <UT> set uplast June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net lossof about 500 mln dlrs this year. David M. Holland, president of US Sprint\'s Dallas-basedSouthwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he didnot know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreedthat for the year the company should have about the sameresults as last year when it lost \"about 500 mln dlrs.\" He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrsover \"two plus years\" to set up its network. Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mlndlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in orderto lease its lines. He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optictelephone line are now \"in the ground,\" and 7,000 miles areoperable. By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company\'ssubscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (insteadof leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of thesecond quarter. Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses alongmicroscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and moreeconomical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic linethe diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of informationas a copper cable 20 feet in diameter. \"By the end of the year, we will have the capacity tocarry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,\" Hollandsaid. He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S.long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> about10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct. Holland said Sprint\'s rates, which were 50 pct lower thanATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephoneexchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all thecompanies have equal access. He said the company was cuttingback its advertising by about 30 pct this year. At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its totalnumber of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 tolast January. \"We\'ve captured the fiber high ground, shown the importanceof it,\" he said. Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said hebelieved ATT \"should be given some flexibility, but should beregulated on pricing plans.\" \"They\'re so dominant in the market place,\" he said, addingthat ATT should be deregulated when \"there is true competitionin the marketplace.\" \"It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,\" hesaid, adding, \"maybe two to four years out, it\'s hard to say.\" Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint\'stwo owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, suchas the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure onthem to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings. \"They are two excellent partners who have stated time andtime again their support of US Sprint,\" he said, adding that hewas \"amazed\" at industry talk that the two companies might bearguing. \"There\'s no evidence of that,\" he said. He said Sprint\'s progress in such areas as revenues,number of customers and construction was on track, even \"aheadin many areas.\" Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprintcurrently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988. \"We want to be in every country that ATT serves,\" he said. He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico butwas working on it.

He said in a parliamentary debate, \"I can now tell the House(of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reservesin September and October (1986) have subsequently all beenrepurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.\" Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressuresthen for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said.The increase in base rates was instead limited then to onepoint. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawsonunveiled last week, he said that \"during the period of foreignexchange market turbulence which followed the somewhatinconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at theend of September, I authorised the Bank of England to interveneunusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that wouldenable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct ratherthan the two pct the market was then pressing for.\" He said that that one percentage point increase, effectedin October 1986, had been reversed by this month\'s two halfpoint cuts in banks\' base lending rates. They are now at 10pct. Treasury figures show that the underlying change in Britishreserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of Englandintervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that theauthorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September andOctober 1986, government sources said.

The CBI\'s monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pctof the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in thenext four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47pct said production would likely remain unchanged. The CBI said the positive balance between firms expectingproduction to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, wasthe highest such figure recorded since 1977. In the CBI\'s February survey, 37 pct of companies expecteda rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remainat present levels and eight pct expected production to drop. The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companiesconsider current order books to be above normal while 58 pctview them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as belownormal. This was the highest positive balance since the questionwas first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said. In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pctrespectively. Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Ofall polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books tobe above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels. In February, 25 pct thought their export books were belownormal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,the proportion of companies rating their export books abovenormal was unchanged between February and March. On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companiesexpect average prices at which domestic orders are booked willremain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct inFebruary. From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expectprices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall,against four pct a month earlier. Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committeechairman David Wigglesworth said sterling\'s more competitivelevel against many European currencies had improved exports. \"But interest rates are still much higher than in ourcompetitor countries and British manufacturers will still haveto work hard to win new business both in overseas markets andin the substitution of British-made goods for imports here athome,\" he said.

Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding buttold journalists the consensus covers the principles involvedin agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done toimprove the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally todiscuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launchedin Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the sameroad...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations isanother matter entirely.\" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal withthe problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how weare going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple ofyears of tough negotiations ahead, he said. \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to ploughimmense amounts of financial resources into the production ofitems that nobody wants to buy,\" he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of thefinancial resources now committed to agriculture to other moreproductive areas. This would help agriculture because some itsinefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, hesaid. Individual segments in many countries may lose in theprocess, but it should result in a more rational system ofworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach arelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably morethan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture inthe negotiations, he said \"one has to be politicallyrealistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agriculturaltrade reform) done in two to three years it\'s going to have tobe as part of a larger package.\" REUTER',1 TRADE}
{0 'Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> islikely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operatingprofits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains inits aviation and property businesses, share analysts said. Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits fromoperations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrscompared with 1.23 billion in 1985. They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain ofabout 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its CathayPacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> unit last May. Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985. Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividendfor its \"A\" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 centsadjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985. Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of thecompany\'s net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits,analysts said. The company\'s aviation division consists of its majoritystake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in<Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pctowned by Cathay. Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuelcosts and greater traffic. Swire\'s share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before theflotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and hassince slipped to 50.23 pct. Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profitsrose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs. Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd,estimates Swire\'s profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs. \"Much depends on properties,\" said Measor. \"And they did a lotbetter in the second half of the year.\" Estimates of profits from the firm\'s wholly owned SwireProperties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mlncompared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985. Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrsfor the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for thesame 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to thelow level of completion of new residential flats. The firm\'sproperties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residentialdevelopment and two luxury housing projects. Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats inTaikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs insecond-half 1986. During the year property prices continued to rise as morepeople bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates,analysts said. \"At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were sellingat 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a yearago,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.)Ltd. Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex inthe central business district of Hong Kong but it will notprovide income until the first stage is completed next year. The company also sold three properties and a part interestin a proposed hotel development, which should result inextraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to JamesCapel (Far East) Ltd. Swire\'s trading and manufacturing operations are expectedto earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping andoffshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

{0 'Australia\'s crudeoil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of atargeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resourcesand Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here. He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association(APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing apackage that would recognise the government\'s economicpriorities while also meeting some of the industry\'s concerns. Evans was referring to a nearly completed government reviewof oil taxation. Evans said there were plenty of examples where targetedapproaches to oil industry taxation had produced good resultsin recent years. These include the reduction in the top marginal crudeexcise rate on \'old\' Bass Strait oil found before September1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshoreoil announced last September, he said. The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for theelimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boostincentives for prospecting against a background of weak pricesand Australia\'s relatively low exploration levels. \"While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity toan already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favourthese kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may stillleave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies aregoing to do in major areas,\" Evans said. He said the government did not intend to change itsresource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now beforeparliament, in response to industry calls to allow allexploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible. As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited tohighly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after acertain rate of return has been achieved for individualprojects. APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax becauseexploration deductibility is limited to successful projects. Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based morethan anything on the government\'s desire to ensure thecertainty and stability of the new regime, adding that majorinvestments have already been planned on the existing groundrules.

Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise theeconomy and deregulate trade policy. Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year whichcut the value of its crude exports in half, is the ThirdWorld\'s sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrsfrom the World Bank in the past 20 years. Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, wasprepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust tolower oil and primary commodity prices. \"We are prepared to support those steps which we believe areconsistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,\" hesaid. He said Jakarta\'s willingness to move quickly after lastyear\'s collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of thedifficulties now faced by other countries. Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against thedollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, andhas announced a series of measures since May intended tostimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalisethe economy. However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plasticsand high tariff barriers remain in place. Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country\'sborrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on thecountry. REUTER',1 CRUDE}

A statement by Williams said it was confident of the meritsof the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care topropose from the outset the right terms, including a full cashalternative. The offer will include a partial convertible alternativeunder which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of theirordinary share allocations. The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers oneWilliams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for avalue of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.

{0 'The council of theAustralian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said itwill press on with its campaign for major improvements toAustralia\'s petroleum taxation structure. The council said in a statement the industry was bitterlydisappointed by the Australian government\'s position ontaxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and EnergyMinister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference. As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to targetany tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach tosecondary taxation of petroleum. APEA had expected the government to make positive responsesto detailed industry submissions seeking the removal ofexisting secondary tax disincentives to exploration anddevelopment, the council said. It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised byEvans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceedwith the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation. Evans told the conference the government did not plan toaccept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allowdeductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure. \"The government\'s unwillingness to allow the deduction ofunsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshorearea in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax isprofit based,\" the APEA council said. The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oilexploration companies that it had realistic answers to theindustry\'s concerns, despite its recognition of the industry\'sproblems, the council said.

The investment in one of Wall Street\'s top brokerage housesis likely to pay off in dollars and international marketposition, they said. \"It\'s part of a trend towards growingcapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreignfinancial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst withKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm describedby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will giveNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions onWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of itsassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in businesssectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory assetmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan\'s largest insurance company and theworld\'s biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve thedeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese lifeinsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japaneseinsurers\' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocksand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets andinstruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official wasappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co\'sboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become alimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller andproblem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going forblue-chip organisations,\" he said. \"It\'s a reflection of what has happened in manufacturingindustries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With ahistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,there\'s an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\" Competition in fund management has grown along with greaterJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mlnyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas andgain experience with financial instruments which are likely tospread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatoryenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms\')diversification.

Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally todiscuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launchedin Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the sameroad...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations isanother matter entirely.\" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal withthe problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how weare going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple ofyears of tough negotiations ahead, he said. \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to ploughimmense amounts of financial resources into the production ofitems that nobody wants to buy,\" he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of thefinancial resources now committed to agriculture to other moreproductive areas. This would help agriculture because some itsinefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, hesaid. Individual segments in many countries may lose in theprocess, but it should result in a more rational system ofworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach arelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably morethan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture inthe negotiations, he said \"one has to be politicallyrealistic...

The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm describedby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will giveNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions onWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of itsassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in businesssectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory assetmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan\'s largest insurance company and theworld\'s biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve thedeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese lifeinsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japaneseinsurers\' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocksand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets andinstruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official wasappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F.

Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller andproblem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going forblue-chip organisations,\" he said. \"It\'s a reflection of what has happened in manufacturingindustries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With ahistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,there\'s an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\" Competition in fund management has grown along with greaterJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mlnyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17to 18 pct, he said.

Another added, \"If the Americans do not get whatthey want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6.\" Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success forthe Paris agreement in its latest investment letter. \"It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing orable to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset thenecessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,\" Citibank said.

Others said there were technical reasons for the sharpdollar drop. \"Window-dressing\" operations by some Japanesecompanies who were selling dollars and buying yen before theend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were underminingthe U.S. Currency. Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was nottechnical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\'s comment theParis accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as arenewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollardown. \"Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear ofcentral bank intervention disappeared,\" one dealer said. The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officialsindicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said.Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bankintervention if necessary. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today thetime had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris lastmonth to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France,the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with thepact. But the Bundesbank and other European central banks werenot detected in the open market during the European morning.Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act. While some said the West German central bank would supportthe dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said theBundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marksor if the decline accelerated. The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when thedollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks. \"The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment,\" onedealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks andgovernments was easier said than done. Some said Baker\'s remarks and U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter\'s warning that the U.S. And Japan were on theverge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift. \"It\'s hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,\" adealer said. Another added, \"If the Americans do not get whatthey want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6.\" Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success forthe Paris agreement in its latest investment letter. \"It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing orable to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset thenecessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,\" Citibank said. It added, \"Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marksis not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marksor even less is expected this year.\" And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987economic report, \"We are looking for a further, more gradual,fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year.\" But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still inforce was not universal. Some dealers said not too much shouldbe read into Baker\'s and Yeutter\'s comments. \"There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has brokendown,\" a senior dealer said. REUTER',1 DLR}

Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerialtalks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasingbecause the multilateral system is inefficient. \"That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATTround,\" he said. \"The very existence of all these bilateralirritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateralsolutions to some of these problems.\" The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Puntadel Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and serviceswere included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and Africannations will also provide impetus for the GATT round tosucceed, he said. \"Clearly those countries need to develop theirexport endeavours and they need open markets for that to happenand that\'s the basic objective of the new GATT round.\" But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. Itwill not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years. \"It\'s a worthwhile activity from their standpoint becausethese debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,\"he said. \"They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT roundas a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or makingpossible debt amortisation in the future,\" he said.

{0 'The U.S. economy is showing somepromising signs of accelerated expansion despite thesluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, privateeconomists say. Some of the slowness experienced in the October-Decemberperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarterthis year, as the tax law changes that went into effect inJanuary slowed business and consumer spending. But some of the latest economic data show signs ofsurprising strength in the U.S. economy, although someeconomists remain cautious about the outlook. The Commerce Department reported today that new orders fordurable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pctrise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defensegoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agencysaid. The February numbers surpassed the expectations of manyfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat toincreases of up to five pct. The January/February employment statistics suggest theGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth forthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, aneconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farmjobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain inJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said. The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate ofabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley. Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuildingtheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in thesecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in thesecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumptionand government spending. He also sees residential constructiondeclining mostly for multi-family housing units. Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of thefourth quarter slowness will continue. Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in thefirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter andshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter. The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in theU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline inthe dollar\'s value over the last year and half. \"The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,\" Levypredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but atleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as theprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas. The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,which soared to record levels last year, will improve this yearand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for theyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year. As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate theirdomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others. U.S. officials believe that would help take some of thepressure off the United States whose five years of economicgrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries. The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market fortheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed toservice their foreign debt. The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at amodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter. There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalancebetween the volume of goods imported to the United States andthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume ofexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the factthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsenedduring the closing three months of 1986. While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporateprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, thegovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measuredby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing amoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years. The government also reported that consumer spending, a keyelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct inFebruary, after falling two pct in January. The Federal Reserve Board also reported that themanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elementsof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery. In its latest report on current economic conditions, theFed said that economic activity in the various regions of thecountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in mostregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish. Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said thepick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to thedrop in the dollar\'s value. He said he does not foresee a majorpick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economywill slip into recession either. He said higher prices on imported products and wage cutsthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeezeconsumers purchasing power. \"That pattern is starting and will continue for a number ofyears,\" Chimerine said.

The Commerce Department reported today that new orders fordurable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pctrise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defensegoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agencysaid. The February numbers surpassed the expectations of manyfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat toincreases of up to five pct. The January/February employment statistics suggest theGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth forthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, aneconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farmjobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain inJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said. The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate ofabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley. Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuildingtheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in thesecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in thesecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumptionand government spending. He also sees residential constructiondeclining mostly for multi-family housing units. Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of thefourth quarter slowness will continue. Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in thefirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter andshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter. The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in theU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline inthe dollar\'s value over the last year and half. \"The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,\" Levypredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but atleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as theprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas. The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,which soared to record levels last year, will improve this yearand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for theyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year. As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate theirdomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others. U.S. officials believe that would help take some of thepressure off the United States whose five years of economicgrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries. The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market fortheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed toservice their foreign debt. The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at amodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter. There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalancebetween the volume of goods imported to the United States andthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume ofexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the factthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsenedduring the closing three months of 1986. While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporateprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, thegovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measuredby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing amoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years. The government also reported that consumer spending, a keyelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct inFebruary, after falling two pct in January. The Federal Reserve Board also reported that themanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elementsof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery. In its latest report on current economic conditions, theFed said that economic activity in the various regions of thecountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in mostregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish. Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said thepick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to thedrop in the dollar\'s value. He said he does not foresee a majorpick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economywill slip into recession either.

{0 'World Bank President Barber Conablelinked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World\'ssixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade anddismantle protectionist barriers. \"We would like to see the Indonesian government continue theadjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulationof the economy,\" Conable told a press conference at the end of athree-day visit to Jakarta. Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia\'shard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by thegovernment to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency. The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlrtrade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend onthe economic policies Indonesia adopted. But he said that in meetings with both President Suhartoand leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specificpolicy changes. \"The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesiangovernment. We are not here to dictate to them,\" he stated. Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badlyhit by last year\'s slump in oil prices which cut its revenuesfrom crude exports in half. Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morningwith Suharto. He voiced support for measures already taken, includingSeptember\'s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts toderegulate imports and stimulate exports. \"The government can rely on the support of the World Bank ina continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities oftoday\'s world,\" he said. The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over thepast 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year. The World Bank would probably like to see furtherdismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduceIndonesia\'s protected monopolies in areas like steel, plasticsand cement, western bankers and diplomats said. The government has already said it will announce furtherderegulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is alsoconsidering selling off loss-making state companies. Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia findfunds to cover its share of development projects, whichotherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed.

However, following his speech, Herrington told Reuters thatthe new report shows an oil import fee \"is not economical.\" Herrington said, for example, a 10 dlr per barrel tariff onoil imports would cause the nation\'s gross national product todrop by as much as 32 billion dlrs.

{0 'Sudan has rejected a demand by theInternational Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation becausesuch a move would have a negative impact on its economy, theofficial Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said hisgovernment also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidieson basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation,said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoumyesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, issome 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared itineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation ofits pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchangerate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditorsfor more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluationshad failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices.Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollarfor foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum\'s thriving black market said the dollarwas sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the governmentincreasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollarsare used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouringcountries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMFand Sudanese government officials do not amount to formaltalks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan\'seconomic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economicrecovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a seriousattempt to tackle the country\'s economic troubles and persuadeits Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill ofhealth from the IMF that it could take to Western governmentcreditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, toreschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan\'s total foreign debt is owed tomembers of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan\'s Finance Minister said last month the country\'s IMFrepresentative had told him the fund\'s executive board was \"verypleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the pastcouple of months.\" The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing DirectorMichel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudanowes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.

{0 '<Shell U.K. Ltd\'s> pre-tax profit onexploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil priceslast year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said. But he told a press conference that due to the highmarginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact ofthe drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985. The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, withPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, hesaid. As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration andproduction sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln. Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/ShellGroup <RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against8.81 mln. Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company\'s crude oiloutput from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for thecompany. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in thecurrent year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the declinein output from the major Brent field, he said. Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gasliquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected tobe maintained in 1987, he said. A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and OspreyNorth Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oilprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg. Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider NorthSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought thecost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget. Day to day operating costs of the exploration andproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the targetis to keep costs per barrel constant. The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading tothe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early togauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said. Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to aprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985. Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <ShellU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987were a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\" In November and December in particular, refining operationshad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oilproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continuegenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip tobecome negative from time to time, depending on pricemovements. A new catalytic cracker at Shell\'s Stanlow refinery willnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about fivemonths behind schedule, following a crane accident whichseverely damaged the plant last year, he said. Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemicalsite. Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by whichcompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for. Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was inthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, hewould expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mlnbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down. He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrainoutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil willfall.

The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, withPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, hesaid. As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration andproduction sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln. Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/ShellGroup <RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against8.81 mln. Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company\'s crude oiloutput from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for thecompany. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in thecurrent year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the declinein output from the major Brent field, he said. Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gasliquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected tobe maintained in 1987, he said. A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and OspreyNorth Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oilprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg. Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider NorthSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought thecost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget. Day to day operating costs of the exploration andproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the targetis to keep costs per barrel constant. The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading tothe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early togauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said. Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to aprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985. Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <ShellU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987were a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\" In November and December in particular, refining operationshad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oilproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continuegenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip tobecome negative from time to time, depending on pricemovements. A new catalytic cracker at Shell\'s Stanlow refinery willnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about fivemonths behind schedule, following a crane accident whichseverely damaged the plant last year, he said. Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemicalsite. Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by whichcompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for. Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was inthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, hewould expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mlnbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down. He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrainoutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil willfall.

Others saidstocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughputvolumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher orlower than the week ended March 13, traders said. The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S.distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another draw reflecting historic seasonal trends. For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocksdown 2.9 mln barrels. Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels saidthey are looking for fairly high consumption rates as thespring and summer driving season gets underway this year,because retail prices are still low compared to recent years. U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrelsfor the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over theoutcome for last week because there is uncertainty aboutwhether throughput levels increased or decreased last week. Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrelshigher, while others think inventories could be as much as fivemln barrels below the previous week. The lower estimates are supported by the belief that cruderuns increased and imports fell. The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the weekended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightlyup or down for the week ended March 20. Expectations for product stockdraws are already beingreflected in firmer prices, traders said.

{0 'The move by foreign exchange markets totest the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown intoquestion the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently oneof the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.

While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen anddollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention tosterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage ofrelatively high U.K. Interest rates. But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the firsttentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday. The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollardown further in a test of the willingness of central banks tointervene. Analysts say if the banks do not interveneeffectively, the Paris accord could collapse. \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6collapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said. He said sterling would lose out as markets turned theirattention to capital movements whereas previously they had beenrestricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies. However, although most analysts and foreign exchangedealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation oreven retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharpdrop in the U.K. Currency. Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices andrelatively high interest rates, they said. Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has beenrunning especially high after last week\'s budget, seen aspopular both with the markets and with British voters. Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in theWest German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 istrailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K. Recent opinion polls showing Britain\'s ruling conservativeparty ahead of opposition parties in popularity have alsosupported the pound. In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off twohalf-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less thantwo weeks.

{0 'Eastman Kodak Co said it willreduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiberoperations of its Eastman Chemicals division. A company spokesman said the company will take \"somewriteoff\" in connection with the action in the first quarterand there will probably be a further \"carryover\" writeoff inthe second quarter. The writeoffs will cover the costs ofplants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connectedwith the staff cuts. Kodak said the division will discontinue production ofpolyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at itsCarolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,mostly in Columbia. The company said about 350 jobs will be affected inColumbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant inKingsport, Tenn. Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achievedthrough an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement planfor employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical ProductsInc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten DefenseCorp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to becompleted by April 30. Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performancehave led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POYproduction will be shut down as a result of its exit from thebusiness. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastmansince last year.

{0 'The shareholders of IllinoisCooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of manyMidwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will voteWednesday on its possible dissolution. The directors of the company called a special meeting andrecommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volumeand increasing costs. Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pulloutof Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capitalstock, led to the call for dissolution. The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearinghouses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regionaland local cooperatives that comprise its membership. Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farmcooperative with major river terminal elevators, that foundedIllinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960. But Growmark became affiliated last year with ArcherDaniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain througha joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark. With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to tradefutures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, presidentof the co-op. Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed acooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. Anotable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which becameaffiliated with Cargill, Inc. Illinois Co-op\'s other members include such regionalcooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industriesin Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, andHarvest States in Minneapolis. Some observors said the demise of Illinois CooperativeFutures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system. Instead of banding together, the individual cooperativesare forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of onecash house at the Chicago Board of Trade. Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farmcooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a fewmajor commercial companies are growing dominant, he said. Don Hanes, vice president for communications with theNational Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperativesexist today, down from 6,700 five years ago. \"The period we\'ve gone through in the past five years hasbeen quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There\'s been a lot ofconsolidation in the marketing co-ops.\" One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to themajor commercials for export, rather than exporting itthemselves, losing potential profits. But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and themulti-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by FarmersExport Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to makefolks gun-shy,\" Hanes said. Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it isapproved, is a result of change in the futures industry ratherthan a change in U.S. agricultural economics. A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm\"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit ofmoney. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way ofdoing business.\" \"We\'re sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said.\"But there are lot of people out there to do business with.There are plenty of capable firms.\" Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketingwith Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futuresthrough a Chicago-based cooperative. \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed toindividuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said butadded, \"The times change and with changing times, comedifferent opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\" Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm hadnothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee youthat this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthyorganization.\" In the year ended February 28, 1986, the IllinoisCooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members\'equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report forthe most recent year has not been filed. Under the cooperative system, income from operations isreturned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members. Income and refunds in the past five years have beendeclining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-opreported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs. \"You\'re dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligansaid. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\" According to the company\'s 1986 annual report, Growmarkowns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the commonshares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capitalGrowmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine thefigure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.Equity is distributed according to each member\'s trading volumeand, as a result, changes from year to year. However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meetminimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmarkpulled out. Reuter',1 GRAIN}

For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemedlike an \"appropriate price.\" Another said \"it\'s too early toproject the outcome.\" \"The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlroffer is inadequate,\" the second arbitrageur said. But he addedit was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much morethan the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today. He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens andthere could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac isable to thwart Mark IV. Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its boardstudies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said itwould make a recommendation by April 17. A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved inseveral takeovers previously and has proven itself to be adetermined bidder. \"They\'re not beginners,\" he said. Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to findanother buyer. \"It\'s a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,\"he said. \"There is only a small universe of people who wouldwant to own the company as it\'s presently structured.\" Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, weldingequipment and other products. \"I\'m telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest forthose who can take the risk,\" said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst atMilwaukee Co.

{0 'The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, withmany delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday. \"Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be inplace by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operationMonday,\" a consumer delegate said. \"The atmosphere is excellent.\" Other delegates said the buffer stock might not beoperational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1,if the rules are agreed by Friday. A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buyand sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working groupthis afternoon -- a big step toward a \"very interesting stage ofnegotiations,\" delegates said. The package, based on negotiating principles informallyagreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit duringfortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director KobenaErbynn and a small group of other delegates. Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers arescheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointlytomorrow. Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buycocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offersystem. He would alert the market via news agencies as to whenhe wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnagedesired, delegates said. The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, ratherthan choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preferenceto ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentialswould be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, todetermine the relative competitiveness of offers of variouscocoas from different origins, they said. The differentials could be reviewed at the request of amember country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager,the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majorityvote of the ICCO council. Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries wouldnot be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, theysaid. The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa perday and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby,intermediate and forward positions, they added. One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is\"transparency,\" meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager\'smarket activities will be public and he will have as littlediscretion as possible, delegates said. After the tin market collapse in 1985, when theInternational Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoadelegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa marketmechanism, they said. Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected tobegin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of theapproaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due toadjourn, delegates said. The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January whenthe new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. Theexisting buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen inplace with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchableuntil rules are agreed. Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not thelast chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules,producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizingmechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices,delegates said.

{0 'Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by ExxonCorp <XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strengthand improving near-term earnings performance through operatingexpense reductions and selective capital spending, the companysaid in the annual report. Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs oncapital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985. Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fellto 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27dlrs share in the prior year.

The Democratic-controlled committee said theadministration\'s export control policies, which restrictshipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year\'srecord 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit. The committee said the legislation will cut government redtape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete withforeign producers since many of the goods are readily availablefrom other countries. Rep.
