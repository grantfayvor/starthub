{0 'USAir Group Inc said Piedmont AviationInc has agreed to be acquired for 69 dlrs per share. The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it hasstarted a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, hasunanimously approved the bid. The offer and withdrawal rightsare to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to befollowed by a merger at the same price. USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option tobuy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding. USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enoughshares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmonton a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department ofTransportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir tobuy and hold shares pending review of its application to gaincontrol of Piedmont. The company said its merger agreement with Piedmontprovides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont\'sprior written consent in any way that would be adverse toPiedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number ofshares to be bought without Piedmont\'s consent. USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares tobe purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum numberneeded to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to besatisfied. In that case, it said if more than that minimum number ofshares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis. In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share incash for 50 pct of Piedmont\'s stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAirshares for each remaining Piedmont share. Last week, Carl C. Icahn-controlled Trans World AirlinesInc <TWA> made a conditional offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrsper share, a bid that was rejected by the USAir board. The Transportation Department on Friday rejected TWA\'sapplication to acquire USAir on the grounds that theapplication failed to comply with department regulations byomitting necessary information. TWA said it would refiletoday, providing the information needed. On Friday TWA said it had already acquired four mln sharesor 15 pct of USAir. Reuter',1 ACQ}

It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and thesmaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardesthit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growthrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct inDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current accountdeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due inlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely tofall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlrpayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomesincreasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline inforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on itstrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after lastyear\'s 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rateis expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with anaverage value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said. \"This is not a crash scenario but the dollar\'s steeperangle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireballrather than a three-point landing,\" the EIU said. \"Talking will not stop the dollar\'s slide for long and theFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five andCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift tomore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighterU.S. Fsical policy,\" it said. It said the key to the dollar\'s fortunes was thewillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Governmentassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss. \"Thus far they have been willing,\" the EIC said, addingthat if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollarwould collapse. To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rateswould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debtcrisis, it said.

But, according to a second source, who also declined to beidentified, Poehl\'s comments were seen by bankers present as adirect pointer to further moves by the central bank to defendGerman industry from an additional revaluation of the mark. \"He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then theBundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,\"the second source said. In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cutin the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after theU.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting todiscuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made sucha move in advance, the sources said. Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, bycuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as earlyas last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,\"No, they wouldn\'t have been. We checked that.\" The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nationstook place exactly one month after the German cut in rates. Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talksbetween central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, sayingthat financial markets had not fully realised the significanceof the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem furtherfalls in the value of the dollar, the sources said. For the first time all participants at the summit agreedthat a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for allworld economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said. The sources said the tone of Poehl\'s comments boostedgrowing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised aroundcurrent levels by international central bank cooperation. One source said Poehl\'s remarks also underlined the factthat the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodativein monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown inWest Germany\'s economic growth. Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the paststressed that the German central bank had no directresponsibility for growth and was solely concerned withcombatting inflation. This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tightermonetary stance from the beginning of December until thehalf-point cut in rates in late January. The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the currentovershooting of the German monetary target would not directlyrespark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to reactimmediately whenever such overshooting occurs. Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank\'smain measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target. Share prices rose in very active trading today, withdealers reporting that Poehl\'s remarks, coupled with a bullishoutlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium,brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

{0 'Uganda, Africa\'s second largest coffeeproducer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffeetalks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee MarketingBoard, CMB, said. \"This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in asituation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne ofrobusta coffee,\" J. Makumbi said when he returned from London onFriday. Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formulato share the world\'s coffee production during InternationalCoffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week. Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which weresuspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that itsquota be increased dramatically. Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually fromcoffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings --had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB. The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to overthree mln bags. For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICOexport quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry. The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties forabout 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employsover half of salaried manpower.

{0 'The suspension of Ecuador\'s crude oilshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last atleast four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports afterrepairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which linksjungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to thepipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oilaccounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisationof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumpingabout 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpdabove the output quota assigned by the cartel, another EnergyMinistry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombianpipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could takeabout 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the endof January, about equal to one month\'s imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billiondlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country\'stotal foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest inLatin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela wouldloan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next threemonths to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic suppliesand would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela inrepayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund MinisterHector Hurtado and including representatives from the interiorand defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos deVenezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate andco-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

{0 'Southern Co said it will take anafter-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later thanJanuary 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclearpower plant has risen abover the amount which retail customersin Georgia will be asked to pay. The company\'s largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, saidthe budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mlndlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the madelast year to Georgia\'s Public Service Commission, the increasedcost will not be included in the utility\'s retail electricrates. Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduledcompletion of Vogtle\'s Unit Two to June 1989 from September1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added. The utility said fuel loading has been completed at UnitOne and the unit is being put through a series of low-powertests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for afull-power license. The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., isco-owned by <Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal ElectricAuthority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate wasdue to several factors, including additional labor costsincurred to keep the plant\'s first unit on schedule forcommercial operation by June. The new figure represents thefirst change in the plant\'s budget since August 1985, when itwas estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs. In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would\"cap\" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to payat 3.56 billion dlrs, the company\'s share of the then projected8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Powersaid, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs. Noting that Georgia Power\'s share of the Vogtle increase is313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a chargeagainst earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes. In addition, the company said, Georgia Power\'s contractswith the joint owners require the utility to buy backsignificant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant\'sinitial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, itwill not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increasethat applies to the buybacks. This bings the total amount that must be charged againstearnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said. Southern said new rules of the Financial AccountingStandards Board, which are effective in January 1988, requireany costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be chargedagainst earnings once that determination is made. The company also said its board has approved a capitalbudget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on theVogtle project. It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-yearperiod 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, notingthis is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years1986-1988.

It said it expected the OECD to post a current accountdeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due inlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely tofall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlrpayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.

The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growthrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct inDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current accountdeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due inlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely tofall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlrpayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomesincreasingly ragged.

The weakness of the West German economy is the biggestsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature asluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast inDecember, the EIU said.

{0 'A free trade pact between the UnitedStates and Canada could spur the economies of both sidessubstantially, according to a study released by the Institutefor International Economics. The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusionto the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada\'sgross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.export\'s by about seven pct. He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue ofgovernment subsidies, end curbs on trade in services andinvestments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and Canada - the world\'s two biggesttrading partners with cross border shipments of about 150billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. Theyare aiming for a pact by next October. Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity ofMaryland, said an agreement should include: - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phasedin over a five to 10-year period; - Equal access to federal government procurement in the twocountries, replacing current \"Buy America\" and \"Buy Canada\"provisions with a \"Buy North America\" provision; - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly financeand transportation; - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favordomestic producers; - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes. Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, thetwo sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties. The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct. He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offsetsubsidies should go first a special disputes commission forresolution at an early stage. Wonnacott said \"bilateral free trade would contribute to theefficiency of the North American economies and to theircompetitiveness in facing overseas producers. He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadiangoods and enable them to benefit from the economies of massproduction. Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those toCanada proportionately, he said, because of the already largeU.S. gross national product. Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areasas export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commissioncould set an example for the current attempt by GATT to writenew and more liberal global trading regulations.

The issue would be designated8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 \"B.\" A further 100 mln stg wasreserved for the National Debt Commissioners.

Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against thebackdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rateswhich had built up over the past two weeks as a result ofsterling\'s strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared tosee lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoonannounced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a ratecut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delaya reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson\'s package of measures. However, in the face of sterling\'s apparently inexorableclimb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure andallow a half-point cut. Today\'s one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the marketas a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further earlyrate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will nowfoster a further half point interest rate reduction at the timeof the budget, although one or two said they would not besurprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities\' attemptslast week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issueda one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing theGovernment bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was soldout within hours of becoming available for trading and themarket pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that theissue announced today would be absorbed by the market asrapidly as last week\'s. However, they noted that although sterling had edged downfrom its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closedon a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday\'s final71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300GMT.

Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering workshould put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a developmentplan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production asearly as 1991, Petro-Canada said. \"We have a high degree of confidence that the westernportion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mlncubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,and that we could produce it economicly using a floatingproduction system,\" Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.John\'s and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, wasdiscovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. \"We\'ve had encouraging results from the eastern portion ofthe field, and we hope this summer\'s drilling will prove upadditional reserves there,\" the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercialprospect and the company wants to move some of those resourcestowards development so it can start generating a return oninvestments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block ofthe Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field\'s EastFlank block, a company spokesman said later. Other fieldparticipants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, TrilliumExploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.

The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so farthis year because of the expectation of higher interest rates. The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at alevel that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where andhow much to borrow, Rotberg said.

A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at anumber of options to identify the most cost effective andefficient way to proceed, including one which would involvemoving the entire grains floor out of the building and into thenearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange. \"One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann\'s agenda items hasbeen to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,\"the spokesman said. Another CBT official, executive vice president GeorgeSladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at aspecial meeting on the exchange floor. A number of presentations have been made with regard torenovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. \"We\'velooked at five or six different alternatives, involving suchthings as flip-flopping the trading rooms,\" he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, wemight use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBTmarkets, Sladoje said. \"If we move out of one floor entirely, then theconstruction period will be about a year,\" he said, adding thatthe issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and thenbe on the drawing board for eight months to a year. The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were verypreliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin untilthis summer at the earliest. In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits,exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporaryhome next door in the present grains-dominated area. This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bondfutures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds andT-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing theMidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat,soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options. Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBTmembers. One senior floor trader said the financial futures roombadly needs renovating. \"There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm andthe financials will move to the grains area,\" he said. The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed wasto renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at atime. \"The first step, after deciding the most effective way toproceed, would be to get architectural and engineeringdrawings,\" he said. He added that it was difficult at present to determine anexact time frame for any possible moves. \"This is a majorundertaking and a process that would spread out over nextyear,\" he said. Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, whichmerged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparingto vacate their floor at the end of this month.

They said Chrysler\'s cost of acquisition was valued at 782mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.

Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler\'s proposedpurchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected thetransaction would carry with it a short-term dilution inChrysler\'s earnings. A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, toldReuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than itwould have been had a deal been struck last year because theimpact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler\'s ability toassume AMC\'s large reserve of tax-loss carryforwardsaccumulated from its losses since 1980. \"There were very serious discussions last fall but wedidn\'t pull it off,\" the source said in a reference to theassassination in November of former Renault chairman GeorgesBesse. \"It\'s too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we\'d doneit before the end of last year.\" In addition to AMC\'s debt and its pension liabilities, thesource said Chrysler would also assume any liability fromlawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called \"an overhangto the company.\" Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them thatthe deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principalin the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mlndlrs cash for Renault\'s equity in AMC\'s finance subsidiary, 25mln dlrs in cash for \"transaction fees\" in connection with theacquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paidAMC shareholders. \"The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,\"analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.

At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness tocooperate on exchange rate issues. The Fed\'s report did not say at what level the interventionoccurred.

Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operationand talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrialcountries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation onexchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said. Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S.interest rates. The dollar\'s swift fall had raised questionsabout whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease.

{0 'The leaf disease corenes pora,which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka andIndonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push updepressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said. Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be savedand must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protectionand Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute ofMalaysia (RRIM), told Reuters. He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenespora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka\'s plantations and may causeoutput to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institutemay ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by thedisease and added that most estates affected belong to theState Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affectscertain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and thatfurther use of such clones must be discontinued. Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber ResearchInstitute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia\'s PPN 2058, 2444,2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia\'s RRIM 725, he said. Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbedafter use of such clones were discontinued. Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which alsoaffects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experiencehas proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added. \"The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is notcurbed in the two affected countries their rubber output maydrop and prices can rise,\" he said.

A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at thefront of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out. Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside thewreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now liespartly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour. The ferry\'s owner is <European Ferries Plc>, majority ownedby Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc <PORL.L>. The operation to right the vessel began yesterday afterdivers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said itcould take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodiesestimated to be trapped amid debris. \"The problem is that in these waters you can normally expectone working day out of four,\" said Daan Kaakebeen of DutchSalvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam. Heestimated the job itself would require 35 working days. Using reinforced cables, salvage experts intend to raisethe ship and set it down into a trench dug alongside. Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss ofthe ferry, one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channelroutes from England to continental Europe. Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry\'s main vehicleloading doors, set close to water level.

{0 'Japanese microchip makers are beingstrong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact onsemiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan\'smarket to foreign chips, industry analysts said. But doubts remain over whether the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuringthe firms, can successfully battle market forces and whetherthe U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of anybreathing space, they said. U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last Septemberhave pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanesechipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said. \"MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industryto get things done,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) associatevice president Peter Wolffe. Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for theJanuary to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensivechips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subjectto the pact\'s price controls. The ministry also asked electronics firms to providedistributors with certificates designating them as authorisedexporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which greymarketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said. U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was injeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American marketsand little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan. But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to theproduction cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corpsaid it would cut production in line with MITI\'s request. \"NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI\'sdemands,\" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"OnceNEC cuts production, it means they all have.\" Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanesefirms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales thatthe Commerce Department assigns them under the pact. \"The best way to lower cost is to produce more,\" said SalomonBrothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec. Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could alsospur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst MattAizawa said. Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any newrestrictions, some industry officials said. \"It\'s like tax avoidance schemes,\" said Steve Donovan, headof MMI Japan K.K. \"As soon as you close one route, anotheropens.\" MITI\'s pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earliershrugged off MITI guidance. \"It\'s getting to be like communism,\" said one. But analysts said output cuts could help by making iteasier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcingfirms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss. \"They\'re going to have to start running their businesseslike businesses,\" Bache\'s Wolffe said. MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaignurging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industryofficials said response has been mixed at best. \"There has been some change, but it\'s not across the board,\"said one U.S. Spokesman. \"The companies have a varying degree ofurgency.\" The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on thetroubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added. Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamicrandom access memory) chips could merely speed the transitionto one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said. Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memorychips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, theysaid. Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing themost advanced technology for microchip manufacturing. Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said. \"The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn\'teven have an office here,\" a source close to the industry said.\"You could question just how committed they are.\" In addition, some industry analysts question theeffectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out thirdcountry chipmakers such as those in South Korea. \"(South) Korea\'s gaining market share,\" said one analyst.\"They\'re the real winners from the agreement.\" REUTER',1 TRADE}

His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the televisionnews agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will maketo Britain later this month. King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be preparedto reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mlnbarrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark priceagreed to by OPEC last December. The King replied: \"Saudi Arabia doesn\'t decide prices byitself but certainly desires price stability.\" Non-OPEC countries \"must help us in a framework of commoninterest so that there is no type of competition which couldprove harmful to everyone,\" he said. Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a firststep towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was notfor Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine suchissues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higherbenchmark. In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahdsaid Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest oil exporter, wasadhering to decisions made at OPEC\'s December conference whichset a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987. A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted thegroup\'s pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.

{0 'China\'s foreign debt reached 27 billiondlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure toshort-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains verycreditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreignbankers and Chinese officials told Reuters. Foreign bankers said China\'s total debt rose sharply froman estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increasedimport commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low,between eight and 10 pct. China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said. Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relationsand Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loanagreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct. Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs inthe 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers saidthey estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion. A Western banker said China\'s portfolio contains too muchshort-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as aresult of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractivelow interest rates in the Japanese market. The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and islikely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said. A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of thecountry\'s total debt at about 30 pct. The Peking representative of a Japanese securities housesaid the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares. \"Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to goelsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,\" hesaid. The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans isin part a result of China\'s inexperience in the foreign capitalmarkets, which it entered only in the early 1980s. \"Officials do not think of China but of their own departmentor firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have thefull backing of the People\'s Republic of China,\" he said. \"The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in otherareas, is to balance central control with giving reasonableautonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms toexercise indirect controls,\" he said. The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over thepast six weeks that China\'s foreign borrowing will not beaffected by a drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrasemeaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal ofCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16. A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China\'sforeign exchange reserves have fallen below the officiallystated figure of 10 billion dlrs. \"The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in themarket, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily inadvance of an announcement the reserves were down,\" he said. The banker said such buying has not been going on. \"Thingsare normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.\" Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985. A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade officialsaid this year\'s outlook for exports, which account for morethan 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthierthan a year ago. The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. Itwas quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago. The official said China has taken measures to improve itsexport performance, including incentive offers to exporters andthe establishment of export production bases. \"We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,\" headded. Official estimates put China\'s 1986 export losses from thedrop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs. A Western diplomat said China\'s foreign debt needs carefulmanagement but its debt service ratio remains very low at sixto eight pct. \"We base our assessment not on China\'s foreign exchangereserves but on its export performance, just as you assess acompany on its performance, not its bank account,\" he said.

{0 'A spokesman for PreussagAG <PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the companywould pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which saidresults in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag hasfrequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986following a difficult year in 1985. Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said inDecember the board would prefer to stick to its policy of notdipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted thefinal dividend decision rests with the supervisory board. The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 comparedwith 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil andshipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends inthe group\'s other divisions. The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domesticgroup would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would dependpartly on the level of provisions. Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from ninemarks on 1984 results after parent company net profit droppedto 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before. The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marksin 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln. The statement said its results in 1986 were affected byunsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as bypoor use of capacity in the supply ship sector. The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarterof 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was anadditional factor behind the drop in results. Preussag said rationalization measures already introducedwould not begin to take full effect until this year. Preussag\'s domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billionmarks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the firsttime consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from itsmajority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG. Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alonewas 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparisonfigures. Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production roseto 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes. Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)subsidiary, whose results are included in the world groupaccounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter oflast year. AMC\'s large losses in 1985, caused principally by theinternational tin crisis, were the reason behind the worldgroup losses that year. REUTER',1 EARN}

Banksbuilt up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow. The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billionmarks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time asan earlier securities repurchase pact matured. Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as sixbillion marks. The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman saidyesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to rollover, the possibility that other central banks may choose toredeem them meant a net infusion was needed. Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week. Banks\' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over thefirst nine days of March.

{0 'The U.S. is urging reluctantcommercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novelPhilippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believesthe innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debtstrategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official\'s comments also suggest that debtors\' pleasfor interest rate concessions should be treated much moreseriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developingnations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want toreconsider the idea of a \"megabank,\" where Third World debt wouldbe pooled, and suggested the administration would support sucha plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At thesame time, however, the official expressed reservations thatsuch a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentinesuggestions that \"exit bonds\" be issued to end the troublesomerole of small banks in the debt strategy, would help tounderpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,the official said in an interview with Reuters. \"All of these things would fit within the definition of ourinitiative as we have asked it and we think any novel andunique approach such as those should be considered,\" said theofficial, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategyunder which commercial banks and multilateral institutions suchas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enacteconomic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. \"The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtorshave been performing well,\" said the official. But he admittedthat the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly anexception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improvetheir role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. \"We called at the very beginning for the bank syndicationsto find procedures or processes whereby they could operate moreeffectively,\" the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions thatcommercial banks create a \"megabank\" which could swap Third Worlddebt paper for so-called \"exit bonds\" for banks like regionalAmerican or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need tolend money to their former debtors every time a new moneypackage was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina inits current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the \"megabank\" was not an administrationplan but \"something some people have suggested.\" Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks areexamining the creation of a consortium bank to assume ThirdWorld debt. This plan, actively under consideration, woulddiffer slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a planwould work in the United States. \"If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,fine. I don\'t think they ever will.\" He pointed out that banks would swap their Third Worldloans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctantto provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan underwhich it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at nomore than 5/8 pct above Libor. \"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it\'s quiteunique and I don\'t think it\'s something that should becategorically rejected out of hand,\" the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would beoffered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a marginabove that of one pct in the form of Philippine InvestmentNotes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have asix-year life and if banks swapped them for cash beforematurity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 pointover Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far toolow. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed atstretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt andgranting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduleddebt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political supportin Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early lastyear, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest ratecapitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to thebanks. \"It\'s no more interest rate capitalisation than if youhave a write down in the spread over Libor from what existedbefore,\" the official said in comments suggesting some ought tobe granted the rate concessions they seek. \"Some people arguethat (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it reallyis is narrowing the spread on new money,\" he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as aninitiative to include plans like the Philippines\'. Reuter',1 INTEREST}

The fundamental keys to the pound\'s rise have beenrelatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimismsurrounding the British economy, analysts said. \"Money seems to be chasing yields,\" William Byers, of BearStearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in thepound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek torelieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing downinterest rates after the nation\'s budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on howwell it is received, but analysts say relative interest ratesand oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K.interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cuttheir discount rates, and extend the pound\'s rally, Sloanesaid. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, butSloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, withsmaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a \"bull flag\" onprice charts, technically-oriented analysts said. \"It makes for an explosive type of situation that oftenleads to a breakout,\" in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadiandollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recentclose at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. \"At this stage of the game I\'d call the market long-termpositive, but for the technical burden of proof you need aclose above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,\" Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stabilitywas the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts.

{0 'Lower production of coconutand palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocksthis year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseedsanalyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said. Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at AlbertaAgriculture\'s annual farm outlook conference that the worldvegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies. \"Prices for edible oils appear to have more upsidepotential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedenteddecline in the production of tree oils,\" Balletto said. Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palmkernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mlntonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output. He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearanceat 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln. Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976. \"If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting thecrush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing inthe edible oils sector could develop,\" he said. \"This would be relatively favorable for the prices of highoil yielding seeds,\" Balletto said. Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed pricesbecause of burdensome supplies, he said. World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increasefor the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,compared with 25.4 mln last year. The increase should result from lower disappearance, asproduction is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7mln last year, he said. World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mlntonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,while production of other oilseeds was lower. Higher soybean production in South America and Europe madeup for lower production in the United States, he said. Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.stocks make up most of those, Balletto said. The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,about half of the world soybean surplus, he said. Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased13.1 mln tonnes. \"During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire worldsurplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificiallyhigh prices caused by the U.S. loan program.\" \"Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseedsprices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as longas the U.S. soybean surplus continues.

High on the agenda will be banks\' complaints about Brazil\'saccompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term tradeand interbank lines, the bankers said. Brazil\'s several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreedlast March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, aspart of a 31 billion dlr financing package. Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupledwith Brazil\'s freeze, raised a spate of technical and legalquestions that the banks want to discuss with Gros. They said they face problems because of the freezerequirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bankunder the trade facility must be deposited instead with thecentral bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switchtheir credit lines from one borrower to another. The requirement to deposit with the central bank has alsomeant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lowerinterest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would ratheraccept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with thecentral bank. \"It\'s caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,\"one banker said.

This drain was offset in part by new currency swaps, whichhad the effect of increasing the National Bank\'s foreignexchange holdings.

{0 'Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair thedamage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week\"searthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months,energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said. Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crudefrom jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, wouldbe repaired with the help of Texaco Inc <TX.N> and a Mexicanand an Argentine firm. President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago thatEcuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exportsfor four months due to the quake. Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds ofEcuador\'s total exports and as much as 60 pct of governmentrevenues. Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuadorwould have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil tomeet its needs until the line was repaired. The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, PatricioQuevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador fivemln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a180-day period. He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp hadgranted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline,50 km of which had been damaged in the quake. In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterdaysummoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issuedappeal for emergency aid for the country.

{0 'The oil services industry is on theverge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oilindustry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on somestocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in thesecond half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in thefirst half, and continue into the next decade. \"People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to goup to start buying,\" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior researchanalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>,Halliburton Co <HAL>, Dresser Industries <DI>, BakerInternational <BKO>, and McDermott International Inc <MDR>,which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, aDallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasingexploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup inoil services will begin in the U.S. \"Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move upfaster,\" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co<HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 isprojected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. \"Thefirst significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in thesecond half of 1988,\" Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similarpattern, Kerridge said. \"Halliburton is the best value,\" said Jeffrey Freedman,vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, addingthe company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of commonstock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cashflow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman\'s second favorite oil servicestock. \"Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominanttechnical leader in the industry,\" Freedman said. \"Schlumberger\'s management shift, asset restructuring,including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and itsconsiderable cash horde sets the stage for the company tomaximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize onthe project upturn in exploration and development activity,\"according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president atRobert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 ctsin 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87billion dlrs. Bernstein\'s Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oilservice companies and said choosing among them is difficult.Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in apossible merger with Hughes Tool Co. Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery butpossibly not as much as other companies because it is not apure service company, Sweeney said. Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to costreductions and streamlined operations, including the sale andleaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup. Reuter',1 CRUDE}
{0 'Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> islikely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12pct of share capital, deputy general-director GuidoSchmidt-Chiari said. The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previousyear and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank\'s sharecapital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986from 2.7 billion a year earlier. Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference whenthe bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profitof 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985. Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast. The banking group\'s consolidated balance sheet total roseto 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion. General director Hannes Androsch said higher investmentwould lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Lastyear\'s better profits had resulted from improvements inservices provided by the bank and also in profits on schillinglending. Schilling lending had grown last year and interest ratemargins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory whencompared with those in other countries, he said. Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home andabroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure. Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business hadfallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheettotal. In an attempt to generate more foreign business,representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, HongKong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans toabolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares anddrawing dividends. Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt roseeight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokerssaid improved results had been widely expected by investors. Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria\'slargest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized andlarge Austrian companies.

{0 'OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment tofixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and anoverall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) todefend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here \"After due consultation withmy colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeriaand all member countries of OPEC remain determined to upholdthe December agreement by adhering strictly to their variousquotas and official selling prices.\" Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. \"We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleadingnews in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC membercountries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in themonth of February,\" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firmdetermination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrsagreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling forOPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixedprices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord butfell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing morethan the agreed level. \"The idea was to suggest that OPEC\'s agreement would nothold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases ofOPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,\" Lukmansaid. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was basedon the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC\'s 13 members, addingthat Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,while the production figures of Ecuador and the United ArabEmirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. \"If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreementsucceed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price levelof 18 dlrs,\" the group\'s president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meetingformerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. \"Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference isat the moment contemplated since most agreements reached inDecember are being adhered to,\" he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrowthe gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed inrelation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied \"We considerthe defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.\" Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawnon stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels wellbelow this time last year and soon they would return to themarket in search of crude. \"We don\'t see that there is going to be any difficulty inmaintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,\"Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which hesaid had contributed to the group\'s efforts to stabiliseprices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-heldview not to do anything to help the market. \"We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term withtwo-thirds of the world\'s reserves in OPEC hands, the future isours. We will use that advantage responsibly,\" he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador\'s outputfollowing an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if theSouth American country would be allowed a higher output quotawhen it recovered from the disaster.

{0 'National Bank of Hungary firstvice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pctdevaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress lastyear\'s severe trade deficit with the West. Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve atleast equilibrium on its hard currency trade. \"It is useful to have a devaluation,\" he said. \"There is now areal push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports.\" The official news agency MTI said today Hungary woulddevalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to beannounced later today. Fekete said the rates would come intoeffect tomorrow. He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary hada higher rate of inflation over the past two years than itsmain partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and5.5 pct in 1986). This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took toprevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks ofthe 1970s, he added. Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and bybetween three and four pct early last year. But the country\'s hard currency trade balance neverthelessfell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985. Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency tradesurplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that amore likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on totalhard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.

{0 'Ecuador\'s deputy energy ministerFernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks onfurther Venezuelan assistance to his country\'s oil industryfollowing last week\'s earthquake, officials said. Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for anexpected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles ofpipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port ofBalao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports. Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lendEcuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs. The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports thatVenezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador\'s entire OPEC quota,set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987. \"All options are open at this moment in the context ofcooperation on oil production,\" a Venezuelan energy and minesministry source said. Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula tocompensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while thepipeline is repaired, officials said. Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and minesminister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks attechnical level, officials said. Industry sources said that among the options are forVenezuela to produce Ecuador\'s entire quota, or for Venezuelaand non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supplyEcuador\'s Far Eastern clients. But the ministry source said that no decision has yet beenreached on the matter, and that an announcement would be madein due course. Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would haveto import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet itsneeds until the line was repaired.

{0 'Chrysler Corp\'s 1.5 billion dlr bid totakeover American Motors Corp <AMO> should help bolster thesmall automaker\'s sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000employees in doubt, industry analysts say. It was \"business as usual\" yesterday at the American Motorsheadquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled byChrysler and AMC\'s French parent Renault, according to companyspokesman Edd Snyder. But AMC\'s future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than ifit had continued with the state-run French car group as itscontrolling shareholder. Industry analysts said the future of AMC\'s car assemblyplant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant wouldbe in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North Americanauto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass. Both plants are far from \"state of the art\" for carmanufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor laborrelations at each. \"Chrysler doesn\'t need that many new plants,\" said MichaelLuckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm ShearsonLehman Brothers. \"They probably will close the Toledo plant andmove Jeep production to Canada.\" Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at thevery least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able towring concessions from the United Automobile Workers unionlocal representing Jeep workers. \"The UAW won\'t be able to hold them up for ransom as theyhave AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will haveunderutilized facilities to transfer production,\" he said. Analysts said they foresaw no major complications thatwould abort a combination which historians said would be theauto industry\'s biggest merger since American Motors was formedin 1954. AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its lossesof more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in Francefor Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it couldnot forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at theearliest. In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman LeeIacocca cited AMC\'s Jeep division as well as its new 675 mlndlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of1,200 dealers as the major attractions. Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventuallyto sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overheadcosts in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incurin the AMC buyout.

{0 'U.K. Interest rates look set to movelower even after Monday\'s half-point cut in bank base rates to10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension ofa British National Savings issue yesterday. The Department of National Savings, effectively a TreasuryDepartment unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launchedin October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-yearprivate investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman saidthe suspension was just a reaction to yields on nationalsavings bonds being way out of line with the rest of themarket. The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutestoday of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, thesecond such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted. They said the near-instant sale of the entire new giltsissue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pctdownpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rateshad to drop sooner rather than later. The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downwardpressure on money market rates remained intact, with thebellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at10-9-7/8 pct. It coincided with another strong sterling rally whichpushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar. \"That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed,\" saidStephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokersPhillips and Drew; \"It is an indication that the market believesrates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-pointimmediately after the budget (on March 17), and some peoplehope for more.\" Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by theNational Savings Department was \"of considerable significance.\" It said, \"the real message ... Is that the decks are beingquickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by thebuilding societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cutin bank base rates to 10 pct materialises.\" Building societies have said a drop in bank base rateswould normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to areduction in mortgage lending rates. Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed theNational Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasurypolicy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut. \"National Savings has been competing too effectively withthe building societies of late. Building society income hasbeen depressed in recent months,\" he said. He and other analysts said Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lidon U.K. Inflation. Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britainthan in most other Western economies with inflation seen risingwell above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 afterlast year\'s 3.7 pct. Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumerprices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rateswould reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct. But Lewis and others noted that building societies had beencomplaining to the government about intense competition fromNational Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for earlymortgage rate cuts. \"The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBRfunding from National Savings, but he must be taking thebuilding societies\' criticism to heart. It looks like theNational Savings move reflects this,\" one senior dealer said. A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on thisinterpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely areaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which hadpushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line withthe rest of the market. \"We are not politically motivated ... Funding was justbecoming too expensive and we don\'t need all that money,\" hetold Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues atleast twice in the past, when offered interest rates were aboveor below market rates. He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late asU.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline andincome was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billionstg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31. In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving\'scontribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of theprevious year, official figures show. Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show afurther increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing thetotal for 11 months above target, government officials said. REUTER',1 INTEREST}

{0 'Lured by the weakening dollar and theconviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, Europeanenergy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reservesto replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said. They said owning oil reserves in a politically stableUnited States is good insurance against future shortages.However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated upcompetition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choicedomestic oil properties. Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil andgas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyershad helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. Allbuyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs abarrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 foracquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and fivedlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm\'s research. \"Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, butwe\'re seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,\" saidArthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist andpresident of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn. \"Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil andgas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,\" he added. Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believethe trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 becauseof the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception thatoil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper tobuy new reserves than to explore for them. Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks tothe need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments andgeneral restructuring throughout the oilpatch. In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of <Total CompagnieFrancaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs toseparately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC>and Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP>. A spokesman for Minatomesaid the company is searching for additional acquisitions. A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, <Petrofina S.A.>and <Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buyvirtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB>,the Oklahoma pipeline firm. But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventureswith experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan\'s<Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc\'s <TX> Texaco USA in a100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined withDupont\'s <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal. Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, itsgeographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil aremore important factors in evaluating potential acquisitionsthan relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula. Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representingInternational Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of <PreussagCorp> and <C.

But he called that a small amount compared to the amountother investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber\'s GeodyneEnergy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend upto 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties. \"The competition is stiff, not only from other foreigninvestors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oilcompanies,\" he said. \"Our company is shopping around because wefeel it\'s substantially less risky than pure exploration.

{0 'Lured by the weakening dollar and theconviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, Europeanenergy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reservesto replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said. They said owning oil reserves in a politically stableUnited States is good insurance against future shortages.However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated upcompetition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choicedomestic oil properties. Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil andgas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyershad helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. Allbuyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs abarrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 foracquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and fivedlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm\'s research. \"Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, butwe\'re seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,\" saidArthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist andpresident of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn. \"Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil andgas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,\" he added. Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believethe trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 becauseof the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception thatoil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper tobuy new reserves than to explore for them. Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks tothe need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments andgeneral restructuring throughout the oilpatch. In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of <Total CompagnieFrancaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs toseparately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC>and Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP>. A spokesman for Minatomesaid the company is searching for additional acquisitions. A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, <Petrofina S.A.>and <Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buyvirtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB>,the Oklahoma pipeline firm. But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventureswith experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan\'s<Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc\'s <TX> Texaco USA in a100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined withDupont\'s <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal. Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, itsgeographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil aremore important factors in evaluating potential acquisitionsthan relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula. Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representingInternational Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of <PreussagCorp> and <C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm hadearmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves inTexas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.

Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supportedin some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries andsix areas of oil production.

The government had already dispatched more than 1,000marines to occupy the country\'s main ports after a nationalseamen\'s strike was ruled illegal last Friday. The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day,represents a stern challenge to the government. The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazildesperately needs foreign exchange. It was a deterioration in the country\'s trade balance whichprecipitated Brazil\'s current debt crisis and the decision onFebruary 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofcommercial debt. There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen\'sstrike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the mostimportant in South America -- and the country\'s other mainports. Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand onthe quays near the strike-bound ships, but the militarypresence here is generally discreet. A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most areout of sight. Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, theDocemarte, seamen\'s leaders said. After explaining to thecaptain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail becausethe strike was illegal, the men returned to work. One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said \"it is apsychological war.

He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few yearsit was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goodsand move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nationwas to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had atrade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900mln dlrs. Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once itsforeign debt was substantially reduced, he said \"yes, I thinkso.\" Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade missionhere during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. productsvalued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of thetype South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talkswith Canadian officials and businessmen. He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reducehis country\'s 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United Statesand also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan. Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange ratesbetween the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buyU.S. goods than Japanese goods.

{0 'An overwhelming majority of Hughes ToolCo shareholders approved a merger agreement with BakerInternational Corp based on revised terms that allow thecompanies additional time to sell a drilling bit business asrequired by the U.S. Justice Department. Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms ofthe proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on howmuch funding the newly combined companies will have to spend onthe disputed drilling bit business until it is sold. An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish afunding limit. The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell throughearlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposedJustice Department consent decree that would have given thecompanies only three months to find a buyer for the Reedbusiness. Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlrlawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with themerger. Hughes\' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct ofHughes\' shareholders approved the merger, said the revisedterms of the agreement give the companies six months to find abuyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previousagreement had proposed a three-month period. Kistler said the the government had also indicated it wouldconsider granting, if necessary, an additional three-monthextension to complete the sale. He said there were \"several people looking\" at the domesticdrilling bit business. The companies, Kistler said, have also decided tovoluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore. Kistler estimated that the merger, which should becompleted in about two weeks, will result in annual costsavings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects \"substantialcutbacks\" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,the name the merged company will take. Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficienciesshould put the company on a profitable course. \"We think thatin the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should seesomething close to breakeven,\" he said.
