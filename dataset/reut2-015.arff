{0 'Roughly half of this year\'s expected130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in theNetherlands, told Reuters. Conditions are generally good and the average sowing datefor the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesmanadded. \"It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we canexpect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least thecrop is off to a very good start,\" he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes ofwhite sugar, substantially more than the country\'s combined \"A\"and \"B\" quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has beenintroduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota \"C\" sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have beenallotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area beingboosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar. Reuter',1 SUGAR}

However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.

{0 'Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.

This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and anindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAFCorp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firmsto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, theKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping formoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy. \"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\" saidPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding,\"There\'s no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones.\" Analysts say the chemical industry\'s biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace\'s John Dosher. Dosher said last year\'s fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.

The sources said the depressed world market had been one ofthe main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the11-member CPA which began on Monday. They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid thebuffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in hiseffort to support prices. Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreedoperation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in Londonlast month and the stock manager is expected to enter themarket soon. Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoasurpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager hasto buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set rangeby buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. \"The world\'s cocoa price at present is just not interesting,\"commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87(October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales inthe near term concerns essentially next year\'s harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry inBrazil, the world\'s number two producer, is in private hands.This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major WestAfrican producers, where sales are made or authorized bycommodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the world\'s top three producers, IvoryCoast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening. Reuter',1 COCOA}

{0 'J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said itsfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting itspreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual statusits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazil\'s suspension of interestpayments on February 20, reduced the quarter\'s net income by 20mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in thefirst three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securitiesunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mlndlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other tradinglosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading andunderwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remaineddifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes sufferingheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whetherMorgan\'s trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loanlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreignexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln andtrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees andcommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but netinvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the firstquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fellto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which meansthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments areactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resumepayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgan\'s allowance forcredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs comparedwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs aftercharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter\'s end were583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a yearearlier.

{0 'Senior Japanese officials tomorrowopen talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditcheffort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a widevariety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan\'s Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days ofmeetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, MichaelSmith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are inretaliation for Japan\'s failure to adhere to an agreement toend dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost andto open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was littlelikelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pctduties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials thatJapan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed tothe full enforcement of our trade agreements designed toprovide American industry with free and fair trade.\" Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan\'ssemiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injuredthe U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which hascomplained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressivetrade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan\'sinaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which lastyear reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning toadhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposalsbut did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan\'sdecision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated senseof MITI\'s power to control Japanese traders. \"The United States has excessive expectations.,\" he said. Tostabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted byexcess inventories since 1985 will take some time.\" He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enoughin trying to sell in the Japanese market.

{0 'Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hopedto maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth tothe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despitecontinuing investments in a reorganization program and effortsto extend world penetration. Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mlnguilders, after 265 mln in 1985. Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe\'sleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters. The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total. Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weakerforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders. Further consolidation of foreign companies, including theincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery <El AguilaS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularlyin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. Thecompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year inrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said. Heineken\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profitnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations hadalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year. Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by theEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beerinto the closed West German market -- Europe\'s biggest beermarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"Wehave the beer, but distribution and sales is the importantpoint,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heinekenhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures. \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the Germanmarket, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding thatwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was veryregionalized. Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible forAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the mostimportant beer growth markets in the long term. He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and withmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, washampered by the lack of hard currencies there. Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine litersper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictionsand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total1986 sales. On-site production is rendered expensive by the high priceof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientistshave been looking at other possibilities. To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched onthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, whichhad sold successfully, Coebergh said. Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional rawmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer werepopular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could notpossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said. Chairman Heineken said the company\'s seven year efforts topenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced. But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\'smarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow thatare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept westernmoney. Reuter',1 EARN}

{0 'UAL Inc may have a response thisafternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its UnitedAirlines unit, a UAL spokesman said. \"Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and weneed to get a clarification out,\" the spokesman said, addingthat there was a \"50-50\" chance a statement would be releasedtoday. The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt. Takeover speculation has driven UAL\'s stock for severalweeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developerDonald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he alsoheld discussions with its chairman. The developer indicated in those talks that he took theposition as an investment, but he revealed no other plans. Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buyingUAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2mln shares. \"United has got to consider this proposal. I think thepilot\'s proposal is realistic. I don\'t exptect them to take it,but it could put some interesting options in front of UALmanagement,\" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst. Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attackwhen it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertzrental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in astrategy to become a travel service company. The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots unionconcerned that the company was not focussing enough attentionon its airline. UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing itsnew focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one. But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street hasbeen busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL aswidespread, indicative to them that big institutions believethe stock is in play. Market sources have said that although Trump attractedattention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as acatalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhapsthrowing the company into the hands of another buyer. \"The first domino is you have an investor with aconsiderable stake. the second domino is the union. That typeof attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,\"said Pettee. \"What\'s interesting is the values are there. There\'ssomething for everybody,\" he said. Reuter',1 ACQ}

A text was released in Washington. He said the effect of lower inflation and financialderegulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished. \"Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modestlevels,\" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowedafter mid-January. \"I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregateswere to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year aswell,\" he added. Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation. \"The pricing behavior of American producers in response toprice increases of their foreign competitors will be crucialfor our economic future,\" he said. Widespread domestic price rises in response to risingimport prices would \"generalize the inflationary forcesemanating from the foreign trade sector\" and might not gain moremarket share for U.S. producers. \"A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well bethe result of such a behavior pattern,\" Heller warned. He said \"we at the Federal Reserve will have to bedisciplined in our conduct of monetary policy.\" Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscaldiscipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint ratherthan new taxes. \"The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindleinflation and certainly would not make us more competitive ininternational markets,\" Heller said. He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pctduring 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.

In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels. As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the United Statesagreed to cut its budget deficit. The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, isto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending. \"If you don\'t deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recenttestimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernment\'s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the UnitedStates. Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession. Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none. But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets. \"There\'s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve theFed\'s flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, it\'s not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters. The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government\'smost vexing and persistent problems. The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this year\'s figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year\'s end. In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget. On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last year\'s Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law. While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext year\'s federal deficit, both the House and Senate BudgetCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs. \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about themost you\'re going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,said Touche Ross\'s Collander. \"To do something more than thatwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\" Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end upshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels. \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptablereduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will nowlook like a failure to Wall Street.\" The budget plan now under debate on the House floor wouldlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the yearbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cuttingdefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from theiranticipated spending levels for next year. The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit ofnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts. Reuter',1 TRADE}

American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billiondlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed tobuy the company.

{0 'Bundesbank board member Claus Koehlercalled on central banks of major industrialised nations tocooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies. In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-releasedhere, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation wasprotectionism and control on capital movements. \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange markettransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to havethem,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts wouldhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar dropto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987. Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange marketshad parted company with transactions in goods, services andinvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions thatdetermined market trends. Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates togrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rateswould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off. \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity,\" Koehler said. The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciationgoing by talking the dollar down posed problems. The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steeprise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the costof European imports. But the volume effect of falling importsto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time tomake itself felt compared with the price effect. \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be goingfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current accountover the medium term,\" Koehler said. A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occuronly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand shouldrise faster than GNP. \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said. If a further appreciation of the dollar was to beprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset byan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S.. But only if there was an appropriate interest ratedifferential would Europe and Japan look for financialinvestment in the U.S. When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bankhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact itsmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions. Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market ratesby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leadinginterest rates because of the signal this gives to the marketand its substantial impact on exchange rates. It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals ofprice stability, economic growth and full employment but alsoto tackle international problems like the exchange rateproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.

But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does notalways help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analystssaid. \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were notso internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor MitsuruUchida. \"Suddenly they\'re standing at the centre of the worldcommunity and in that sense, they\'re at a loss (as to) how toface the situation.\" Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row withLondon over efforts by Britain\'s Cable and Wireless Plc to keepa major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete inJapan\'s lucrative overseas telephone business. The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rivalgroups, arguing the market cannot support more than onecompetitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which nowmonopolizes the business. It has also opposed a major management role in the plannedmerger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm onthe grounds that no such international precedent exists. The ministry\'s stance has outraged both London, which hasthreatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the mergerplan is evidence of Japan\'s failure to honour pledges to openits telecommunications market. Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which itsays have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan\'s cartelephone and satellite communications market.

Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech thatmonetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflowsrequired cuts in interest rates. Separately, West Berlin state central bank president DieterHiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall belowits lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he wasnot making a forecast on interest rates, however. Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollargained slight background support from the speculation. But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the moneymarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may eitheroffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rateand let the strength of banks\' demands set the allocation rate. It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much lessthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pactexpired.

A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, saidthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations andshould not have produced disappointment. \"The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and tradepolicies to redress current imbalances are of a differenttimescale than currency markets operate on,\" the source toldReuters, \"This is a political process which takes time.\" Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp inBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident oncurrency markets today. \"Did people really expect a patentremedy?\" he asked. Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday\'s meeting was onlythe first in a series and said the market would watch carefullyin the next few weeks for any changes in positions. A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus wasnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move byJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth couldlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position. Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary inpushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming monthswhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle tosupport the Paris accord.

{0 'Remarks by central bankers raised somehopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchasepacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of amove in the near term, money market dealers said.

Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but thedrop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.

But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by thepact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels. The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates onrepurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday. Bundesbank officials have already said they favour morediscreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather thanthe more public adjustment of leading rates. The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate andallow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the casesince it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it mayallow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself. Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.

Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreignexchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervenedagain to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The communique said, \"The ministers and governors reaffirmedthe commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recentParis meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions willbe essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustainglobal economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.\" It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan\'s rulingLiberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what thecommunique termed \"extraordinary and urgent measures\" includingan \"unprecedented front-end loading of public worksexpenditures.\" The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven broughttogether ministers and central bank governors of the sevenmajor industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitmenton cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Pariswhen they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at thethen-current levels.

{0 'Dutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS>reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mlnguilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profitsfor 1987. Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billionguilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said itsrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and achange in accounting practice. It added that revenues wouldhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred. Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainlydue to its life insurance business. Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rosedespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums andhigher personal risks. Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damageinsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss. In the United States, revenue in guilders from health andlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a changein accounting for U.S. Annuities. AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personalinvestment influences that it should be accounted differentlyfrom the more traditional insurances. This change in accounting practice and another change toaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mlnguilders. AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profitswere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initialcosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in TheHague. In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emergedin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initialcosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat. Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON inMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by thesecosts and made only a small contribution to the group\'sprofits. AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwillfor Monumental Corp. AEGON\'s net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December1986, against 3.46 billion the year before. REUTER',1 EARN}

At a news conference after today\'s G-7 meeting, Miyazawasaid the ministers and central bank governors did not believe atotally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economicfundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only areaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, hesaid. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve hadconcentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially themark, had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since theParis accord was not worth being called fundamental. \"As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expressionof \'current level\' is rather vague idea,\" he said. The yen\'s movement in the past several weeks is within therange agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointinga level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in thestatement, he said Japan was exceptional among the sevenbecause the yen appreciated against the dollar while othermajor currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party hasjusted adoped a package to reflate the economy while othernations are not supposed to produce new measures in a shortperiod since the Paris agreement.

Dealers restrained their underlyingbearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday\'s meetingof the finance ministers and central bankers of the top sevenindustrialized nations in Washington.

Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelledspeculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities areprepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level isstill inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February. Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that thekey psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of theauthorities\' permissible range.

Monetary sources also said they understood thatSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.

{0 'The global economy is expected toweaken this year, adding new worries to an already seriouspoverty outlook, economic analysts said. For finance ministers and central bankers attending thisweek\'s semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fundand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add anadditional concern. The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pctthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985. In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, ameasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said. For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0pct from 3.5 pct last year. The new figures are considered a major disappointment tothe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in theindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oilprices would assist their economic recovery and help them copewith growing mounds of debt. IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believedthe industrial country economies would move up to an annualgrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade. Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for sometime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning intoan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth. Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthierstates for markets for their products as well as financialassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations\' economies poses fundamental worries. Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, haveonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,including the key one of exports. The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but ittoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only2.3 pct, according to the IMF. For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, theUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany toignite their economies but with little apparent success. The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar andthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. tradedeficit. Reagan administration officials have been saying that theimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been muchslower than expected. The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it hasto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time towork through to payments flows -- probably at least three yearsto get a resonably complete effect.\" The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take evenmore time on this occasion.\"REUTER^M',1 GNP}

He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far thisyear were not endangering the government\'s five pct inflationtarget. The government\'s perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said. High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment\'s target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.

To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986. Cuevas said employers were heeding the government\'s call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987. These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.

{0 'Lead prices have risen this week againsta background of a finely balanced physical sector, traderssaid. Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buyingor if labour problems develop in North America, they added. London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant ata time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening andprices tending to drift lower. This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the lowlevel of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physicaldemand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed. The supply problems are not new but are beginning to befelt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traderssaid. The lower supply levels result from a number of differentfactors around the globe. Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countriesbecause of production and transport problems, lack of Spanishexports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz\'s smelter atLinares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meantadditional demand being directed to merchants who in turn havebeen drawing on LME stocks. In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters\' Port Pirie,South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeksfor maintenance. Although the company said it would meetcommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks. And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnesper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocksand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within theU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production anda regular supplier to the world market. Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said. On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held upquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reportedin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in thefirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buyingorder was filled by merchants in March. Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead pricesthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg andestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three monthsdelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal inGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is oftena target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said. On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerpand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,and this is believed to be in strong hands. Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowestlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouseswhich are not popular with merchants putting togethershipments. But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes sincethe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due tosecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed suppliesaffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions onthe transport of used batteries. Labour negotiations in North America will play an importantpart in determining the direction of prices, with contractsexpiring end-April at Cominco\'s Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,Mine/smelter and at Doe Run\'s Herculaneum, Mo, smelter. Noranda\'s New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contractexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view ofstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months. Traders said LME three months delivery, already attractingspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on currentfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premiumto 20 from four.

The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed itwould pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on1986 business, despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currencydealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses fromthe currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, butthe VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an \"upper limit.\" VW said in a statement following today\'s supervisory boardmeeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal indetail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreigncurrency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditingcompany. VW has said computer programs were erased and documentswere faked in the alleged fraud in which it believestransactions intended to protect it against possible foreigncurrency losses were not completed. VW\'s former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger wasarrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of havingevaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985profits. VW\'s group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks andparent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommendan unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company hasalso set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,which were issued last year. Analysts have described the helddividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5billion marks, with the result that its total dividend paymenton 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves inorder to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels.

Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Sevencountries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he saidcentral banks would continue to intervene \"as and whennecessary.\" He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do moreto stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined byJapanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about the risk of asimultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and WestGermany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budgetspeech to the British Parliament. \"If anything I\'m a little bit less concerned, but there isstill a risk,\" he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasinginterest rates to support the dollar, he said, \"If there is aneed for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn\'t need tobe a rise in interest rates in the United States.\" Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday\'smeetings at the slow progress the United States had made inreducing its budget deficit. \"We believe there will be some worthwhile progress inreducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that itcontinue year after year,\" Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts tostabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the sixweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise againstthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness inthe Louvre accord, he said, \"I don\'t think so. If there had beenno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\" Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawsonsaid, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode... but one has to be vigilant.\" He said yesterday\'s G-7 statement, which affirmed that\"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been\"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean thesame thing,\" he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanesemeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source ofweakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa\'spresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulatedomestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediateincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the packagealso involved a second stage to increase expenditures duringthe second half of this year.

{0 'Trading on the London potato futuresmarket will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of theLondon Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statementto floor members. It was in response to strong representations by the PotatoMarketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion ofprice which they say will result in large deliveries into thephysical market when the April futures position expires. The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futurestrading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore therelationship between futures and physicals. Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and corneringof the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigationsby the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), theInternational Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and otherparties, found no evidence to substantiate this. The main complaint from some sections of the physicalmarket is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium overthe PMB\'s average ex-farm price. April futures traded thismorning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB\'saverage price of 104 stg. Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there isa two-tier market for physical potatoes.

{0 'Steel stocks, which have had a healthyrunup recently, still present some short term investmentopportunities, according to some steel analysts. But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firmprices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will endsoon. They recommend taking profits. \"It\'s that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\" saidCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"Orders will bestrong for about two months, and there are signs that some(order rates) are starting to dive already.\" But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison seessome short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp<X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp <BS>, Armco Inc <AS> and Inland SteelIndustries Inc <IAD>. \"There is still some attractiveness to steels over theshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates andrising prices,\" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations tomake them more efficient. Despite his bearishness, Merrill\'s Bradford continues torecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround. Armco\'s steelmaking operations are profitable, the balancesheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment businesshas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradfordnoted. \"It\'s not a high-quality investment situation yet butthey\'ve come a long way,\" he said. \"We think the stock will do moderately better than themarket,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said. Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,against losses last year. Armco\'s 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, hesaid. Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buyon it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else haveit,\" he said. The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr ashare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, andfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lotdepends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX\'s salescome from oil and natural gas. Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum ofSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company\'s done a lot(of restructuring), more than the market\'s given them creditfor,\" she said. She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX wastrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts ashare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in1986. Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, hasbeen recommending the stocks since last November. Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the groupalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through thethird quarter. But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel)prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\"he said. Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonaldropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives thannegatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domesticindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which shouldcause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

{0 'Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment\'s officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report. The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil\'s total soybean crop. It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness. However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said. The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said. Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said. Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested. During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said. New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests. Reuter',1 WHEAT}

{0 'U.S. retailers\' lackluster March saleswere due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect arecovery in April. \"Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, butunderlying business is better than the numbers indicate,\" saidBear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein. Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter\'s occurance. Thisyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is threeweeks later than last year. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and aseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted5.7 pct last year. \"The obvious question is whether these numbers indicatethat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appearto be because liquidity and employment are rising,\" saidanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham. Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming inaccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expectedto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986\'s rise. In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticketitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to manyanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as theholiday nears. \"Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect acontinuing strength in the housing market,\" said EdwardBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co <S> which reported anoverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women\'ssportswear were also excellent. \"Sears\' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but evena modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishmentdue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,\"said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. J.C. Penney Co Inc <JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp <DH> wereamong the weaker performers with comparable stores salesdeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney\'s store andcatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson\'soverall sales rose 4.8 pct. Penney chairman William Howell said, \"Sales continuedstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged fromvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressedsouthwest.\" \"Penney\'s been shifting away from leisure time activitywear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,but are currently hurting sales,\" said Greenstein of BearStearns. Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter forthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that \"Hudson had a toughercomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.\" Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lowerthan last year. \"Retailers are not planning for much - inventories arebeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but salesare coming through anyway,\" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.

The federal government reported today that the monthlysurplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,double January\'s 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher thanFebruary 1986\'s 189 mln dlr tally. \"Hopefully it\'s the beginning of a trend,\" said RichardsonGreenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto. Economists generally don\'t expect such large gains over thenext months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout theyear. \"We thought the trade balance would improve ... over theyear, and it certainly looks as if this morning\'s figure isindicative of that,\" commented economist James Donegan at theToronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd. Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billiondls in the month. \"Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value ofexports up by 5.9 pct in February,\" the agency said in itsmonthly report. Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billiondlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs. Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would endup three to five billion dlrs higher than last year\'s dismal10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billiondlrs. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touchedoff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning afterclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in earlyafternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved tradeperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggishCanadian economy. Money market analysts said the positive trade news touchedoff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning afterclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday. The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in earlyafternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved tradeperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggishCanadian economy. They say the country\'s consumers, who have been spending ata torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlaysthis year and this should help curtail the flow of imports intothe country. Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the UnitedStates, by far the country\'s largest market, is expected to bestrong as a result of a projected rise in American consumerspending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. \"We maintain what\'s going to drive Canada\'s exportperformance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland\'sDonegan. But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economistWarren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook andsaid it could be a mistake to read too much into February\'strade upturn.

{0 'The House Armed Services Committeehas voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiledmaterials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary. The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity andquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals. The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Billwhich will be voted on in the House next month. The purpose of the measures, passed by the committeeyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discouragesell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, astaff member of the committee told Reuters. \"They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by beingmanaged properly,\" said the staffer. \"Management of the stockpileover the last 10 years has been atrocious.\" Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to aWhite House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The staffer said that under the measures passed by thecommittee the Secretary of Defense would have more influenceover decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials. The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrsworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. Thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials. He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to managethe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit. These agencies included the Office of Management and Budgetand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said. The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpilemanagement was counter-productive, he said. Reuter',1 STRATEGIC-METAL}

{0 'The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the SovietUnion to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month. In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, theUSDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated becauseSoviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the lastmonth. USDA said the increased purchasing is \"somewhat surprising\"because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates. All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,USDA said. Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnesmiscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said. USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop sufferedthrough a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed. The severe winter \"is believed to have resulted in aboveaverage winter-kill,\" USDA said. Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter lossesmaybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buyinggrain recently. USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnesgrain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheatand 12 mln tonnes coarse grain. Reuter',1 GRAIN}

{0 'The United States\' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977. \"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable,\" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990. \"However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction,\" Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government\'s negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. \"An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy.
