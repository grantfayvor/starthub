{0 'If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in aserious way, Japan investment managers say. The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollarsecurities, have already sold U.S. Equities. But \"if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happenyesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdrawsignificant funds from U.S. Shares,\" said Akira Kawakami, deputymanager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd\'sinternational investment department. An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japaneseinvestment in U.S. Bonds. \"Japan-U.S. Interest ratedifferentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothingin the absence of dollar stability,\" said Kawakami. U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picturefollowing the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effectshould be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise. But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiatingto see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar washolding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning. \"Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks inNew York yesterday, most are still looking for chances tolighten their U.S. Stock inventories,\" Hiromitsu Sunada, managerof Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co\'s international investmentdepartment said. Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 pointsto 1,738, the market\'s biggest percentage drop since 1914. \"Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,considering the dangers,\" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy generalmanager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd\'s fixedincome securities marketing group. Japanese investment at home could start to pick up oncemarkets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managerssaid. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in oneor two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield forthe 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said. \"The basic background which has supported the stocks andbonds markets has not changed,\" said Norio Okutsu, assistantgeneral manager of Nikko Securities\' bond department. \"But newoutflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing.\" However,this was already evident three months ago, he said.

{0 'Asian cocoa producers are expandingoutput despite depressed world prices and they dismisssuggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior. \"Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their marketfrom our product,\" said a spokesman for Indonesia\'s directorategeneral of plantations. \"We\'re happy about our long-term future.\" Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales inAsia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitablefor European tastes. They were responding to comments by London traders thatlarge tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesiaand Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoaprices. London traders said the Asian cocoa was consideredunsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and ahigh level of free fatty acids. Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia\'s Cocoa Growers\'Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and theUnited States if it did not produce a type suitable for WesternEurope. A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said theLondon market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa withhigh-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans. \"When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything totalk down prices,\" the spokesman said. He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces. PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoayear ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exportedto West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to theNetherlands and Britain. The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry officialwho wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problemwith quality and would continue to expand sales. He describedcriticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as \"trade politics\"and said Jakarta\'s traditional links with Dutch buyers meant itdid not have any difficulty with exports. Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia\'s two biggest commodityproducers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside theInternational Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Officials have said Malaysian production is expected tototal 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987. This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because ofthe end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country\'s largestcocoa growing area. Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output isprojected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnesthis year as young trees mature. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers andtraders said they could last out low prices longer than WestAfrican countries. According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices wouldhave to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) tomake cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic. Some traders believe the main quality problem is withharvesting and fermentation techniques. One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtuallyindistinguishable from West African output if treated in thesame way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysianestates. REUTER',1 COCOA}

{0 'Rises in West German and internationalinterest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank hasno interest in higher capital market rates, BundesbankPresident Karl Otto Poehl said. \"We consider the interest rate increase that has occurredhere and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,\"Poehl told an investment conference. \"I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interestin higher capital market rates,\" he said. Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced atender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80pct. Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate haveseen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pctat last week\'s pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender inlate September. The Bundesbank\'s reduction of the key allocation rate to3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injectionsof money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct. These moves to cap interest rates followed a meetingbetween Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt. Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmedtheir commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability. Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening inWest German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of thedollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended. But the dollar rallied on news of Monday\'s meeting innervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday. Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was notdue to central bank policy, but to markets\' expectations, andcurrency developments. Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said \"Youhave to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue apolicy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.\" The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, hesaid. Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution tointernational cooperation in interest and monetary policy. The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its moneysupply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said. \"Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interestrates have risen substantially more,\" Poehl said. This had to be taken into account when considering recentrises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due torising international money market rates that had spilled overinto the German market, he said. Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so farignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits. \"The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance isdefinitely underway,\" he said, noting that this was not sonoticeable in absolute figures.

PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, witheight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.

{0 'Plunging Tokyo stock prices will preventthe Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could evenforce it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,government and private economists said. A rise in interest rates now would only serve to sparkfurther selling of shares that could ultimately have a majordeflationary impact on the real economy, they said. Although Bank of Japan officials have consistentlymaintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discountrate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by thecentral bank\'s apparent decision last week to countenancehigher rates on commercial bills, dealers said. But today\'s stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed toraise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about arenewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said. Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as themarkets concluded that the stock market\'s collapse precludedthe central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discountrate increase. A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent afurther drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. \"They need tosupport the stock and security markets,\" he said. But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to changepolicy for the moment, although one admitted that the centralbank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock pricescontinue to plunge during the rest of the week. Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed theeconomy is better placed now to cope with the deflationaryimpact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago. With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop instock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer andbusiness confidence, one government economist said. \"There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won\'tbe that big,\" said another. Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on theirown, although they do participate through trust funds and otherinvestment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turnedto financial market investments for profits during last year\'seconomic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them torefocus their attention on their core businesses, he said. Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that ispartly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies haveshifted funds away from financial investments to increaseinventories and step up capital spending, one governmenteconomist said. In deciding what response to make to the steep stock pricedrop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether priceswill continue to fall further and then decide if they pose agreater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,one central bank official said. \"That will at least take acouple of days, if not weeks,\" he said.

President Suharto, in an opening speech to the IndonesianPetroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extendcontracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas. \"In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, thegovernment of Indonesia has basically approved of extendingproduction sharing contracts under the present laws,\" Suhartosaid. \"Apart from that, the government will keep improving theinvestment climate in order to accelerate the development ofthe petroleum industry,\" he said. Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association hewas aware that the oil industry needed to be assured thatcontracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would berenewed before they would invest in further exploration. \"As we all have heard this morning, the President is fullyaware of this situation,\" Subroto said. \"The government has already made the political decision toentertain this time problem by inviting the existing producersto continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on aselective basis.\" Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oilreserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oilindustry sources say. Subroto said the government was also working to ease otherproblems, including granting easier terms for remote areas ordeep water conditions. But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-wayand that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration nowthat the oil price had recovered. President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer oftechnology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oilindustry for the regions in which companies operated. Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil companyPertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and productionexpenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast tofall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in1986. Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operationcontracts with foreign oil companies. Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for fieldoperations was a government priority. There had beenmisunderstandings between the government and the oil industryin certain areas, such as when a field is designatedcommercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made. He said the government wanted to finalise contractextensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in themeantime to maintain its exploration drive. Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintainexploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expirewithin 10 years. \"This need in itself is some sort of guaranteethat we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.\" Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewalbetween 1991 and 2001, industry sources said. Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involveddetailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted. Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensionswould be selective, based on how much capital would beinvested. REUTER',1 CRUDE}

{0 'A voluntary compliance system formonitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewedskeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts andtrade sources. \"Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because ofthe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as itbecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other,\" oneanalyst said. On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter saidthe Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement avoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation tomonitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill. Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffeeimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to theU.S. government until Congress approves the monitoringauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,it will still be allowed entry. While many believe producers will not seek to add to theoverburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe somewill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu ofmonitoring controls, trade sources said. \"Last time, there was a lot of false information submittedto customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,\" aU.S. Customs spokesman said. \"Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but whenits hands are tied, it doesn\'t have the authority to demandForm O (documents tracking merchandise from source todestination),\" he said. Many see it as a true test of whether producers andimporters will abide by the quota system. \"It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in thequota agreement,\" said one major U.S. roaster. \"Last time we had a gentleman\'s agreement, the trade didnot act as a gentleman,\" said another analyst adding, \"withoutthe need to submit documents, the ball will be in theproducers\' hands.\" Some feel that importers will take advantage of thevoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-membercountries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falselylabelled. According to customs officials, several green coffeeimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffeefraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navybeans. \"If there\'s that much of a discrepancy between prices forone country and another, producers may be teted to get rid oftheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and bycircumventing the quota provisions,\" said Paine Webber analystBernie Savaiko. Still, others believe that producers will not be hardpressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation inthe U.S. in the near term. \"It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would nothave some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary systemseemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have somuch coffee, I don\'t think that it poses that much of athreat,\" one trader said.

{0 'U.S. And West German reaffirmation ofsupport for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamentalproblems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind thecurrent collapse in stock markets, London economists said. \"There\'s going to have to be some acknowledgement that thedollar is going to be allowed to slip,\" said Richard Jeffrey ofHoare Govett. \"If not, there is going to be continued fear thatwhen pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced totighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in theU.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\" But some economists added that Wall Street\'s crash, whichdragged other major markets down with it, may help curb thevery problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflationfears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits. \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street...It\'s some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" saidGeoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments fromother London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears offurther falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationarypressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist theequity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context ofwhat happened in the last couple of days to jack up theirinterest rates,\" he added. Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its primelending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fedchairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financialsystem. The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stockcollapse would spill over into the economy, via a bankingcrisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists saidtoday\'s whiplash moves do not have long term significance andthat markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals inmind. \"The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economicgrowth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides amore realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,\" said Capel\'sDennis. But he added that markets are still very much indanger. \"The liquidity doesn\'t disappear...All it\'s doing isdisappearing from the equity markets,\" Dennis noted. David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said worldmarket turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,as implied by West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg\'s remarks that intervention to support currenciesis still on. Last week\'s dollar fall was partly triggered byexpectations that the Germans were more worried about the moneysupply impact of such intervention than maintaining currencystability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, saidMorrison. \"The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. Tostabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,\" he said. Reuter',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stgsurge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely tonudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy aslong as sterling remains in its present robust state,economists said. An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over thepast two days will in any case subdue personal consumer creditdemand which has largely been behind growth in lending. \"In the normal course of events the markets would have beenextremely worried about that figure,\" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,which compared won stg August rise, U.K.Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to fleefrom plummetting equities into the relative security ofgovernment securities. Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching aday\'s low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tonethroughout. U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morningafter little more than a token blip as the figures came out. Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by bankswould under other circumstances have prompted market fears of arise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, \"Withthe financial markets doing what they\'re doing, that\'s the lastthing the Bank of England would want to do,\" Spencer said. \"The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long assterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,\"said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell MontaguGilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow moneymeasure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August\'s 4.5 pctgrowth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury. But \"The fact that overall broad money growth has sloweddown is a rather encouraging sign,\" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to afall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad moneyaggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August\'s 22 pct. It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bankof England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base ratesto 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently bynews of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending. Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry inthat period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets. Housing and equities were the key two asset markets ininfluencing consumer behaviour, he said. In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equitymarkets in the past few days, \"There will almost certainly be astraightforward impact on consumer spending and on retailsales,\" Temperton said. \"Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth inconsumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,\" he added. \"I think the stock market has decided that the bank lendingfigure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a veryserious panic and a flight to quality,\" Spencer said. A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to lookat all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowlythan bank lending. Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lendingwas evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavypersonal sector borrowing. Figures from the Banking Information Service showedpersonal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Muchof the rise reflected quarterly interest payments. REUTER',1 INTEREST}

{0 'Norway\'s September oil output rose by 22.2pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd inAugust, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here. Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output atseveral of Norway\'s biggest fields and resumed production atfields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk fieldrescue project. Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway\'svoluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oiloutput, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabiliseoil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets. Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend theproduction restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on allits North Sea fields for the rest of the year. Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norwaywould extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth. The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, whichpumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said. Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which usethe Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August whilePhillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence. BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ulafield, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after droppingto 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown. Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpdlast month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the companysaid. September production was also sharply higher at theStatfjord field. Norway\'s 84 pct share of Statfjord, whichextends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpdagainst 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske StatsOljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said. Norway\'s 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, likeStatfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpdin September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previousmonth, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said. Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpdin September, compared with 100,188 in August. Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said testoutput at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarltotalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd inAugust. Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring onstream a second well, cutting September production to just twodays. REUTER',1 CRUDE}

Lyng\'s comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourgendorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguayround agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26. Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the planseeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposingcurbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe. The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of allfarm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and haspressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reachinga global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said theReagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies isunrealistic.

In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he wastroubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exportsthat the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it. \"Yes, I\'m troubled with that a little bit,\" he said. \"There\'sno question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,the longer it is to wean it.\" In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growinglist of commodities to an increasing number of countries.

But they added Washington set the stakes high by testingthe limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets wereplunging. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment tocurrency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,according to official statements released late Monday. Only 13 hours after the statements were released, theBundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banksliquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pctfacility rate offered last week. While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbankpresident Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also addedmoney market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want astrong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday. \"It\'s round one to the Americans, \" said Richard Reid,senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew inLondon. But Reid added, \"We shouldn\'t forget that it has taken oneof the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the WestGermans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05percentage point.\" Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tighteningof West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall andfuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid. Six leading industrial nations agreed under February\'sLouvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetarypolicies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency marketsand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours tradingin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar wasquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday. Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at DeutscheGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on worldstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in WestGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday. \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock marketlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fitswith Baker\'s wishes, then all the better,\" he said. No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and theBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following risesin the U.S., Aschoff said. Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the centralbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and hethought the global rate increase was a cause for concern. Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First BostonLtd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreatand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn\'t won the war as thesecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it wasbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\" Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord wasreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidityat 3.60 pct, Keating noted. Economists said the United States now appeared to haveagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and supportthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.

{0 'U.S. military planners ruled outIran\'s Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attackmounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into theIran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said. U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform andraided another in what the administration called a \"measured andappropriate response\" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack lastFriday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters. Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rigrather than an onshore economic or military target such asSilkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington tolimit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both athome and in the Gulf. \"It simply demonstrated the United States will take militaryaction when they (Iran) take military action,\" Norman Polmar, adefense analyst and author, said. He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran theembarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoidingan escalating spiral of attack and counterattack. In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and thepotential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft thatcould have been shot down had they taken part in an attack. Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraqwar, said the United States apparently chose a limited targetto keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept aSecurity Council call for a ceasefire. \"We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there\'s anychance at all,\" he said, adding that the action made it cleartougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping. In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagonto have been turned into a military command post -- Washingtonalso sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran\'seconomic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform hadbeen used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in thelower Gulf. \"We have chosen a military target, but we also have shownIran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exportingcapabilities,\" Cordesman said.

{0 'The Bank of New York Corp <BK> said itreaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despitethe drop in the Bank of New York\'s share price to 30-1/8, aBank of New York spokesman said. \"The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,\" aBank of New York spokesman said. Irving would not comment on how the drop in the marketaffects its position on the bid or whether it would buy backany of its own shares. Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequateand said it wanted to retain its independence. In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs pershare in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for oneIrving share. At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs pershare for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said. According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tenderfor all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis. Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop wouldaffect the acquisition. \"If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approveit, but Irving hopes the offer won\'t go to the shareholders,\"said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. \"And the market is saying the deal won\'t go through,\"Alpert said. \"The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed atpresent. If Irving wouldn\'t go with the offer at 80 dlrs ashare, then they won\'t go at a lower price,\" another analystsaid. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could affordto retain its original offer. However, industry sources were more uncertain aboutprospects for the deal. \"With Irving\'s price so low, Bank of New York\'s offer willlook good to Irving shareholders,\" said Michael Flores, aconsultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm. The drop of Irving\'s share to 44 dlrs per share, which isabout a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increasesthe chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likelyto depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the bankingindustry. \"Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can\'t usetheir own stock to make acquisitions because their share priceis too depressed,\" Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank, the only otherpossible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said. \"In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobberedmore than the acquirees,\" another analyst said.

{0 'As official Washington sought torestore investor confidence after Monday\'s Wall Streetcollapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire fromcritics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis. Baker\'s weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank forboosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of aninternational accord to stabilize currency values. Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, wasamong those who said the treasury secretary\'s statements helpedspur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investorsthink that a clash between the two major economic powers woulddamage the world economy. Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, \"Ithink the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, Ithink, was partly due to statements that have been made bysenior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.\" It was adispute that should never have happened, he added. Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at ahastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the UnitedStates on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip toScandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis. Said one U.S. analyst of Baker\'s weekend remarks, \"Histiming could not have been worse.\" One government bond salesman in New York said, \"He actuallythought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smackthe dollar down would work. That doesn\'t show muchunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\" However, some analysts said West Germany\'s stubborn marchtoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker\'s hand. \"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but ifyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financialmarkets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca ofNikko Securities International in New York. \"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, somaking him responsible for it was a little like killing themessenger,\" he said. After Monday\'s talks, the U.S. and West German governmentsmade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced togetherin Paris in February, was still in effect. Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might bea prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar tothe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday\'s Wall Street crashwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values. Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy aboutBonn\'s refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep theglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interestrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite. He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59thmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economicexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a hugemarket for debtor country exports. Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worriedthat the Republican party might face next year\'s presidentialelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badlytarnished. A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debtcrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that hasalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate. \"There\'s no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on theeconomy, and it\'s important that the psychology turn aroundquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, andeventually there\'ll be a serious price to pay economically,\"former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in atelevision interview.

{0 'The United States may lift anadditional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan laterthis month, Reagan Administration officials said. President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions onJapanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and thirdcountry markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods. The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct onJapanese color television sets, hand-held power tools andportable computers. Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June afterJapan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market atbelow production costs. Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memoryand recall purposes in a wide variety of computers. The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of thesemiconductors in third countries, where they had been takingsales away from American-made semiconductors. They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions wouldbe lifted by the end of the month. The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening theclosed Japanese markets to U.S. goods. U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan\'s compliancewith the agreement earlier this week. The periodic reviews are to continue and the remainingsanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan isin full compliance with the semiconductor agreement. reuter',1 TRADE}

{0 'Trade Representative Clayton Yeuttersaid on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canadaand Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing theglobal trading system. He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set backworldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them. The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguayto liberalize the global trading system and to include in ittrade in agriculture and services such as banking. Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meetingmarking the second year of their bilateral accord. TheCanadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yetbeen approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament. The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually removetariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods andmany services. Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israelipacts \"other countries have realized that if they want tocontinue to have access to the world\'s largest market, they hadbetter get serious about improving the GATT.\" The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasingshipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantiallyincrease the gross national products in both countries. Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts shouldserve as important precedents for progress in GATT. Yeutter said, \"increasing trade is one of the keys toenhanced political and economic stability around the globe.\" He said, \"a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not onlyfor advanced industrial nations, but also for other countriesthat need to increase trade in order to better their standardsof living.\" Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progressmade in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting toprotectionism. He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congressthat would force the United States to take retaliatory actionsagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the UnitedStates if the countries practiced unfair trade. The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. tradedeficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is stillrising. Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard toresist, but the pending legislation would undermine PresidentReagan\'s efforts to liberalize the world trade. Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto. He said, \"President Reagan will veto any bill that containsserious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.\" Reuter',1 TRADE}

The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over twopfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said. The announcement of the meeting, also attended byBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneouslyin Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New Yorkmarkets. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policiesaccepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministryspokesman in Bonn said. The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York\'s close of1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks. The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the marketreacted to Baker\'s criticism of rising West German interestrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said thatWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord. Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged tocoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, withthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulatingtheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budgetdeficit. West German government sources said rising West Germanmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvrepact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interestrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been risingsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fedraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50. German yields have also risen over this period, but lessmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged upshort-term rates by changing the terms on its securityrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering themoney market. The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany\'sinability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in theBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetarygrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,bank economists said. This monetary tightening reflected a switch from thepragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to themore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger. In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity thismorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises. \"They (the Bundesbank) just don\'t want to come too muchunder American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser atSwiss Bank Corp here. \"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite asignificant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating,economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
