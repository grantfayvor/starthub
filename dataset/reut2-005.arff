{0 'Central banks have easily beaten backthe foreign exchange market\'s first test of the industrializednations\' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said. In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar,sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. Butoperators got their fingers burned as one by one the centralbanks signalled their displeasure. \"So far G-6 has been a roaring success,\"said James O\'Neill,financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA. \"The central banks are sending strong signals that theywon\'t tolerate any kind of momentum building behindcurrencies,\" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank. On February 22, the finance ministers and central bankgovernors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.-- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord underwhich they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability ofexchange rates around prevailing levels. The agreement was viewed by many in the market as anattempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeabletwo-year decline against major world currencies. And initially, traders indicated their respect for theaccord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower. But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday beforethe G-6 accord. The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economypicked up steam in February at the same time as the West Germaneconomy was regressing. But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gavetraders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed theidea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines. Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bankactually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simplytelephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about tradingconditions. But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around1.85 marks. \"The market was surprised that the Fed showed itsface so soon,\" said Marine Midland NA\'s O\'Neill. Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of Englandintervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before theG-6 pact. Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies likethe Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor aftertraders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuantto the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit playson dollar/mark and dollar/yen. The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improvingU.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for theincumbent Conservative party in any general election. \"There was a real run on sterling,\" said Anne Mills ofShearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterdayand from a peak of about 2.98 recently. \"There\'s been someheavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday\'sU.K. budget,\" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp. As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. andBritish central banks, they acclerated their shift intoCanadian and Australian dollars. But here too they werestymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency\'s rise. The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollartoday, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday. And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said. The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. centstoday from a high of 69.02 Thursday. Analysts said the central banks\' moves to stifle suddenupward movement, leave the market uncertain about its nextstep. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to avery tight range against the dollar for several months. The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound longsterling/short mark positions established lately. \"Because of the change in perceptions about the health ofthe German economy, the funds from those unwinding operationsare ending up in yen,\" a dealer at one U.K. bank said. Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,lower industrial output and slowing employment gains. Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities whohave invested heavily overseas, for example in Australianfinancial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of theend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the mostcontroversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit withJapan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test ofthe dollar\'s downward scope against the Japanese currency. In its latest review of the foreign exchange market throughthe end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that itintervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen. \"Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level inJanuary. But the market has to bear in mind that time marcheson and the situation changes,\" said McGroarty of Discount. Reuter',1 MONEY-FX}

The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on tradingvolume, he noted. \"We\'ve had a decline in activity as recenteconomic statistics have not greatly changed people\'sviewpoints on interest rates,\" Mains said. The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of theeconomy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchangemarkets after the Paris initiative has made for \"less thanebullient market action,\" Mains said. He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be infor a retracement after the recent rise as they are near thetop of the trading range. \"My view is that the economy remains relatively strong andmarket participants will see that current prices areunjustified,\" Mains said. Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also notedthat the market is showing very little momentum and lacksretail interest. \"All of the movement occurs at the opening,\"afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said. Although data during the week was mildly positive for bondprices, the small rise in February producer prices and downwardrevisions in January retail sales and industrial productionwere \"not real exciting,\" said Prudential Bache analyst FredLeiner. \"There is no one factor that will push us through the highsat this moment,\" Leiner said. Next week\'s revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross nationalProduct is also likely to be of little interest to the market,said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in thedirection of bond prices over the next month. Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth isaround three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventoriesreflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showedthe largest increase since 1979. \"The key question will be not whether there is a largeincrease in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase issustainable or a one shot deal,\" Kahan said. He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNPstemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag onsecond quarter growth.

{0 'Negotiators at a United Nationsconference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement(INRA) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact, conferencechairman Manaspas Xuto said. \"We have resolved major differences of opinion,\" he toldReuters. Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord,to replace the current one which expires in October. Xuto said: \"I welcome the friendly and cooperativeatmosphere that has prevailed without interruption\" since thetalks began last Monday. \"It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try toratify the new agreement,\" he added. The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of theU.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is thefourth such meeting in two years. Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on fourpoints: 1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months. Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervalsbetween price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact. 2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices oversix months prior to a review is below (or above) the lowerintervention price (or the upper intervention price), thereference price will be automatically revised downwards (orupwards) by five pct unless the International Natural RubberOrganisation council decides on a higher percentage. If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes,the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pctunless the council decides on a higher percentage. 3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price atwhich the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes isbrought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore centsabove the floor price -- or 152 cents. 4) The floor price will not be breached. Throughout thetalks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal tolower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., Was withdrawn lastnight, setting the stage for compromise. Legal drafting of provisions will start next week andformal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries takingpart in the conference is expected to take place on March 20. The current conference was widely seen as the last chanceto clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a newfive- year pact had failed, the last round breaking down inOctober over consumer demands for tighter controls of thebuffer stock. The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy andBritain are the major consumers. UNCTAD\'s latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct inrubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988.

{0 'Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazersaid OPEC\'s December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and therewas no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television newsagency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around threemln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPECquota. Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest oil exporter, willcontinue to restrain production as long as other OPEC membersadhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its productionceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed pricesaveraging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed ZakiYamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for newmeasures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meetingwill take place as scheduled.\" Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and allmembers were abiding by its agreements. \"We\'ve heard news every now and then of violations but theywere not at all verified,\" he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February buthave firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels astraders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program asdevised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere tothe agreement,\" he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from theNeutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floatingstorage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters andVisnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil pricestability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmfulcompetition with OPEC. \"Saudi Arabia doesn\'t decide prices by itself but certainlydesires price stability,\" he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom hadreturned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mlnbpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand andover-production by some OPEC states. \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being playedby OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by othermembers of OPEC,\" Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during thirdquarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed \"I am sure then theOPEC members will consult with each other and take thenecessary measures.\" Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain whendemand for petroleum products generally falls in the northernhemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperationfrom non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Unionagreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports afterhe visited them on OPEC\'s behalf earlier this year. \"We did not ask any country to do anything. These wereprogrammes they thought were necessary to stabilise marketconditions and to help themselves attain better pricingconditions,\" Nazer said.

The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture MinisterDenis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convenedby the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London onMonday. While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeralceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President FelixHouphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country\'s capitalYamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates willbe present throughout the London talks, the official said. Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours thathe or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of publicmourning in the West African nation helped depress already lowworld cocoa prices Friday. The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the newpact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of theworld\'s cocoa exporters and consumers. He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCOCouncil chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March27. The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of thepact\'s buffer stock which producers hope will boost a markethit by successive world cocoa surpluses. Ivory Coast did not participate in the last internationalcocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparkedhopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices. REUTER',1 COCOA}
{0 'Tense trade relations with the U.S.And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposedEuropean Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats areexpected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers heretomorrow. EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on theEC Executive Commission\'s proposal to impose a hefty tax ondomestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off aproposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations. The proposal was the most controversial part of a reformpackage, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later thismonth, of the EC\'s Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen asthe root cause of the EC\'s persistent financial problems and oftensions with major trading partners. The proposal is described by its promoters as astabilisation program which would penalise a new sector goinginto massive overproduction and complement proposals to cutcereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forwardtax. They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fatsproduction and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left bya fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some twobillion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farmcosts. It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers aswell as foreign exporters, led by the United States. The diplomats said the protests had been received from mostcorners of the developing and developed world, ranging fromSenegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,Iceland and Norway. The proposal had little chance of approval by ECgovernments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it asBritain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal alsounconvinced of its political or economic wisdom. Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France andGreece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did notseem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added tothe list of products affected. But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promoteanti-EC action, and the foreign ministers\' debate shoulddemonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal withinthe EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.

{0 'Saudi Arabian businessleaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing outproblems facing the private sector of the kingdom\'soil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across SaudiArabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry andcommerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in themountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,has been organised by Saudi Arabia\'s chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and CommerceMinister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will airproblems facing commerce and industry after last year\'s slidein oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment ina private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,the world\'s largest crude exporter, needs to foster privateenterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the MiddleEast recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturingand trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accordreached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boostprices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at theturn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing downforeign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure ofconfidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since lastNovember, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in thenumber of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporatefinance manager in Riyadh said: \"Banks are still reluctant tolend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I amnot sure if it is firmly based.\" Some businessmen and bankers point out that governmentspending is still under tight control and the non-oil economymay still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before thebudget said: \"While industrialisation has continued to be one ofthe government\'s highest priorities, the recession, thepayments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudiand foreign investor interest in industry.\" It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be amajor issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences forindustrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a majorsource of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with hugeinventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories.Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reachedagreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotelsconglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled adraft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals ofbank debt. Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likelyto discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms tostep up investment in the kingdom. A British government delegation has just left Riyadh afterholding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudioutlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraftworth five billion stg.

Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AXsports model, he said: \"All the budgetary forecasts that we havebeen able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvementin 1987, compared with 1986,\" he added. Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group,increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct infirst two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It isaiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after11.7 pct in 1986. The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of theEuropean market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from2.9 pct in 1986. \"Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet thedemand,\" Calvet said. \"This is a relatively new problem for us.\" Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cutthe deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to moderniseits range and improve productivity. Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen\'s 1986profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs. This weekend he said that those profit estimates \"remainabout the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic.\" Some of this optimism is due to the early success of theAX, launched on the French market last October. It will beavailable throughout most of western Europe within four months. The car has registered just over 20,000 sales. It is being built at Citroen\'s large plant at Aulnay-sous-Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany andVigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of1,000 cars a day. The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate modelbetween its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed tocompete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa. The AX had built up its market share in France to aroundfour pct last month.

{0 'Leading industrial nations will meetagain next month to review their accord on currency stability,but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for nowthe countries will live up to commitments to speed up economicgrowth. The narrow currency movements of recent weeks stronglysuggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed thenormally unruly financial markets and next month\'s talks seemlikely to build on that stability. A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreementlast month was the main reason markets were calm. But he said in an interview that financial markets alsounderstood, \"That all six countries concluded that the measuresto be taken over a period of time in the future should fosterstability of exchange rates around current levels. That is infact what has happened since Paris.\" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part bythe decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet andcease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives. Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, butleft room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings. The official refused to comment, however, on whether theagreement included a secret pact to consider furthercoordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nationshave taken jointly several times in the past year. On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies werewithin ranges broadly reflecting underlying economicconditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budgetdeficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth. The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position infuture international talks. \"I think these changes will strengthen the President\'s handpolitically and the stronger he is politically the better offwe are with the Congress and the better off we are ininternational fora,\" said the official, an Administrationeconomic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to thecontinued conduct of our initiatives.\" But the official also said the Administration would resistcalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a targetEuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability. Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened tostop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood tohave intervened to curb sterling\'s strength. International monetary sources say finance ministers andcentral bankers, who will review market performance and theirown economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washingtonjust before the April 9 policymaking meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund. The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Parispact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April toshow that an economic stimulus package was in the offing. Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recentlywhen Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl toldbankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates ifthe Fed was ready to follow suit. A Reagan Administration official said this would show therehad been some change in approach on the part of the centralbank in Germany. But he declined to comment on the prospects for action bythe Fed and the Bundesbank. \"If there is such a provision it is private and if I talkedabout it, it would no longer be private,\" said the official, whoasked not to be identified. Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bankis keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if themajor economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinatedaction could be on the April agenda.

The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises mettheir supply obligations in January and February. Production of oil, the country\'s main export to Westernnations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct. Economists said this reflected the huge investments pouredinto the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reversethe stagnation in production which began in November 1983. Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a declinein Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6billion in 1985. Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targetswere also not fulfilled, but did not give figures. Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionallybad weather at the start of the year and stricter qualitycontrols imposed on enterprises.

{0 'German banking authorities areweighing rules for banks\' off-balance sheet activities in anattempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticatedcapital market instruments, banking sources said. Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options areunder closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they mayresemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. ToJapan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank\'s division ofbanking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-Britishproposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate. But banking sources said West Germany was more likely toproduce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals. \"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latterstages,\" one representative of the German Banking Association inCologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year. All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, WestGermany\'s four major banking associations and the FederalBanking Supervisory Office. Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changeswould require a revision of Germany\'s credit law, which hasbeen in effect since 1934. Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fitpresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentarypolitical process of changing it, banking sources said. Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limitedbanks\' lending to 18 times shareholders\' equity plus reserves,on a consolidated basis. But lending ratios do not extend to several newerinstruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currenciesand various innovative types of interest rate hedges. The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposalslay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swapsthan interest swaps. But even if German banking authoritiesagree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree onhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk. U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series offormulae for assessing the stream of payments involved inswaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financialintermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.This is the so-called market-to-market value. But German authorities are likely to consider this much toocomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule oflending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness ofthe borrowers involved, the sources said. The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extendedto include banks\' securities portfolios, are zero for publicauthorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreignbanks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers. A further complication is that the more flexibledefinitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May putGerman banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said. Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version ofthe U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.And British authorities, the sources said. One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-datedforeign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, bebrought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despitethe fact that the risk may be entirely different. How new regulations will affect foreign banks here wasuncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status andapplied for a full banking licence over the last two years inorder to lead-manage mark eurobonds. But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lendingratios will severely hamper foreign banks\' freedom of movement,particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if theyare required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,the sources added.

{0 'European sugar beet plantings areexpected to show little change from last year, despite recentfirmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said. A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while,so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lowerareas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations. Trade analysts said their private reports give similarresults and do not differ significantly from the first estimateof stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by WestGerman sugar statistician F. O. Licht. Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agriculturalexperts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improvedseed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a lateboost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointingstarts to growing seasons. Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producerswill grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the worldmarket. This is what is produced in excess of the basic areaneeded to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full andpartial price support, respectively. Some analysts said the open row that broke out last weekbetween producers and the EC commission over its export policycould have serious implications for future sugar output. Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearlyone mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks asthey feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate forthe gap between high EC internal and low world market prices. However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resistinghigher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a futurecut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added. In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quotasugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said firstplanting intentions indicate an area about the same as lastyear\'s 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year. \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesmansaid. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, whitesugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are notencouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar outputlast year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlandsbut below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11. In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans,since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industrysources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is stillvalid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmedby just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average. Licht last week estimated West German plantings at areduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year. British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signedup U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This shouldyield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year\'s cropequalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes. British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnesof whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from moreconsistent disease-resistant seed types. Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, WincentyNowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated SugarIndustry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polishproduction costs and there is no way to convince farmers toincrease the area above the already signed contracted level. The national plan, set before prices began to rise, putplantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes. World prices have less impact in Italy than in France orGermany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared tothe domestic market, an official at the national beet growers\'association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete butsurveys suggest a drop from last year\'s 270,000 ha, especiallyin the north where some farmers have switched to soya. Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higherthan expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar. Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from arecord 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comesinto force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largestDutch sugar processor, said. The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnesof white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, theNetherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugaragainst a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes. \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higherthan it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugarreally worthwhile,\" the spokesman said. Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet plantingintentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year\'sSoviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year. Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, butdiplomats said policy is to balance supply with domesticdemand. The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings areestimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year. A spokesman for Denmark\'s largest beet concern, De DanskeSukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchangedfrom 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha. In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domesticdemand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 haagainst 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugarcompany Svenska Sockerfabriks AB. Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due tolate sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, downfrom 37,600 in 1986.

{0 'The credibility of government efforts tostabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to thetest over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how abuffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, governmentdelegates and trade experts said. Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped whenInternational Coffee Organization members failed to agree onhow coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, manyof the same experts gather in the same building here to try toagree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work. The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding theInternational Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock lossesrunning into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also castinga shadow over commodity negotiations. The ITC\'s failure has restricted negotiators\' ability tocompromise as governments do not want to be involved in pactswith built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clearlines drawn between aid and trade. A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basicelements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement inGeneva at the weekend. Some importing countries insist the International CocoaOrganization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied withquota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa tobe bought. One consumer country delegate said this would\"distort, not support\" the market. Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCOfor destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffeeprices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts canfounder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoafutures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling hasalso contributed to the recent slip in prices. The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the\"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,which came into force at the last ICCO session in January butwithout rules for the operation of the buffer stock. Consumers and producers could not agree on how it shouldoperate and what discretion it should be given. The agreementlimits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says itcannot operate on futures markets. A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying orselling operations, were carried forward from the previousagreement. Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy onall cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes. The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group onbuffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will beover non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock shouldpay when trading different types of cocoa. Another workinggroup is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrativematters, and the full council meets on Thursday. Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock fundsshould not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-membercountries such as Malaysia. Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the bufferstock should buy it rather than compete with chocolatemanufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas. The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linkedto the one over differentials for different qualities. European industry and trade advisers have suggested as acompromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that canrepresent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futuresmarket\'s existing differentials for different qualities. Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par ontothe London market. Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa. Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse wouldoperate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell thehighest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower. The January talks were slowed by a split inside theEuropean Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with Francesiding with producers. EC representatives met in closed sessionin Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common groundand, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positionsamong the 12 nations. The source said the EC will be looking for signs offlexibility on the part of producers in the next few days andwill be able to respond if they are there. One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer splitsaid consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less andbacks the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support themarket where trade buying is not.\" In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell theircocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers. Other, more technical, issues still outstanding includewhether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced\"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it isbuying then accepting offers. In either case, delegates said, it is accepted thatproducers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers ofcocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in away that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.

{0 'Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the countryrecover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said. But the French bank\'s plan, which would effectivelypostpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for severalmonths, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52members of the loan syndicate. The pipeline that carries all Ecuador\'s oil exports wasruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five monthsto repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair. President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated totaldamages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said thatEcuador as a result would maintain January\'s suspension ofinterest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt. Payments were halted in January because of the drop in theprice of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador\'sexport earnings and 60 pct of government revenue. Although sympathetic to Ecuador\'s plight, many banks in theParibas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a jobfor international financial organizations and not forcommercial banks, bankers said. The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed lastOctober 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for aLatin American nation since the region\'s debt crisis erupted inAugust 1982. Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel stronglythat the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, theyfear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditionsfor Latin borrowers will be set back. \"There\'s a lot of reluctance by the other banks.

{0 'Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazersaid OPEC\'s December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and therewas no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television newsagency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around threemln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPECquota. Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest oil exporter, willcontinue to restrain production as long as other OPEC membersadhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its productionceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed pricesaveraging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed ZakiYamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for newmeasures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meetingwill take place as scheduled.\" Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and allmembers were abiding by its agreements. \"We\'ve heard news every now and then of violations but theywere not at all verified,\" he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February buthave firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels astraders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program asdevised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere tothe agreement,\" he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from theNeutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floatingstorage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters andVisnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil pricestability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmfulcompetition with OPEC. \"Saudi Arabia doesn\'t decide prices by itself but certainlydesires price stability,\" he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom hadreturned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mlnbpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand andover-production by some OPEC states. \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being playedby OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by othermembers of OPEC,\" Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during thirdquarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed \"I am sure then theOPEC members will consult with each other and take thenecessary measures.\" Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain whendemand for petroleum products generally falls in the northernhemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperationfrom non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Unionagreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports afterhe visited them on OPEC\'s behalf earlier this year. \"We did not ask any country to do anything. These wereprogrammes they thought were necessary to stabilise marketconditions and to help themselves attain better pricingconditions,\" Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals ifthey saw fit.',1 CRUDE}

One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters adraft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct futureinterest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 yearrepayment term. Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday. Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow onTuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador toMoscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue. One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange ratefor trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on arate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollarwhich Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating officialrate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar. The officials said part of the debt would be paid inexports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture. Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open thedoor for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-builtsteel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-yeardevelopment plan ending June 30 1992. Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprintand glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases ofcurrently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet militaryhardware, the officials said. An estimated 65 pct of Egypt\'s arsenal is still made up ofSoviet-supplied equipment, one official said.

{0 'Leading industrial nations will meetagain next month to review their accord on currency stability,but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for nowthe countries will live up to commitments to speed up economicgrowth. The narrow currency movements of recent weeks stronglysuggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed thenormally unruly financial markets and next month\'s talks seemlikely to build on that stability. A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreementlast month was the main reason markets were calm. But he said in an interview that financial markets alsounderstood, \"That all six countries concluded that the measuresto be taken over a period of time in the future should fosterstability of exchange rates around current levels. That is infact what has happened since Paris.\" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part bythe decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet andcease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives. Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, butleft room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings. The official refused to comment, however, on whether theagreement included a secret pact to consider furthercoordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nationshave taken jointly several times in the past year. On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies werewithin ranges broadly reflecting underlying economicconditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budgetdeficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth. The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in futureinternational talks. \"I think these changes will strengthen the President\'s handpolitically and the stronger he is politically the better offwe are with the Congress and the better off we are ininternational fora,\" said the official, an Administrationeconomic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to thecontinued conduct of our initiatives.\" But the official also said the Administration would resistcalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a targetEuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability. Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specificagreement to defend those bands with intervention. According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar. There is no official confirmation that specific bands wereset, although the agreement used the term \"ranges\", for the firsttime in an international economic agreement.

{0 'A year after squeezing to power with anarrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister JacquesChirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulationschoking the French economy. But France is still waiting for a promised industrialrecovery the government says will follow from its free marketpolicies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. Butso is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a yearand the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pctin 1986, is uncertain. Forced last month to cut the government\'s 1987 growthtarget and raise its inflation estimate, Finance MinisterEdouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. Butsome government supporters say they fear time for an economicmiracle may be running out. The political clock is ticking towards Presidentialelections due by April next year. France\'s economic performance, led by a mixed cast ofright-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixedreviews from non-partisan analysts. For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies atnewly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government\'s outstandingachievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectualrevolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries ofstate control. \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --but set in their context of structural reforms, they areexcellent,\" Develle said. But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chiefarchitect of the government\'s free market policies, may bepursuing a mirage. \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce anexplosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chiefeconomist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it\'s an illusion.Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\" Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controlshave been largely abolished, labour regulations have beenpruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugelypopular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banksand industries to private investors. Since December, nearly five mln French investors havebought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> and glassmaker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA <SGEP.PA>, the first two statecompanies brought to the stock market under the 300 billionfranc five-year privatisation plan. Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports ofcapital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money hasflooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to liftthe market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct sinceDecember. At the end of last year the government abolished pricecontrols that had existed for 42 years on services such as carrepairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention smallbusinesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy. The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer pricesin January, partly responsible for a forced revision in theofficial 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct orless. \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when youconsider that prices are now free for the first time since1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas. Other achievements include a major reduction in the state\'sforeign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target anddown from 153.3 billion in 1985. But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and agradual improvement in industrial productivity, the Frenchfranc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliatingthree pct devaluation against the West German mark, its secondsince Chirac took power. A recent report by the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development pilloried French industry forfailing to produce the goods that its potential customerswanted. Outside the mainly state-controlled high technologysectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adaptedto demand\" and over-priced, the report said. French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreedwith the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government isthat if you give them freedom, the employers will invest andmodernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they likefreedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said. And despite rising industrial investment and theintroduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier. The problem for the government is that there may be littlemore it can do to prod the economy into faster growth. French producers failed more than most to take advantage oflast year\'s oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on theshaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries likeWest Germany and Japan, they say.

{0 'With the April 15 tax return deadlineless than a month away, confused taxpayers will be convergingon H and R Block Inc\'s offices to interpret the new tax codes. Financial results for the nation\'s largest tax preparer areexpected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a\"bonanza,\" analysts say. \"For the short term the key word is confusion, Block VicePresident Tom Bloch said in an interview. \"When Congressdrastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparersbenefit,\" Bloch said. \"Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and placethem side by side to compare them, more people will throw theirhands up and say \'I\'m going to get help,\'\" he said.\"Tax forms will look very different next year,\" he added. Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block\'sfiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains overfiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share onrevenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block\'s fiscal 1987earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs. \"Next year, Block could have a bonanza,\" Buchbinder said.Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show again of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. Inthe 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,up 1.5 pct over the previous year. The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mlnindividual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 taxseason, up from last year\'s 94 mln forms. Professional taxpreparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, accordingto the IRS. For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bringclients into Block\'s 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,there are some changes in the act that will have a negativeeffect, Bloch conceded. Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the taxreturn, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. Inaddition, some low income wage earners will be taken off thetax rolls, he said. Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try tooffset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average costfor each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be upabout three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, hesaid. Block expects \"some expansion\" this tax season of itselectronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS andcan speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and byhow much it wants to expand into the seven cities madeavailable for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted. The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directlyfiled this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected inthe 1986 tax season. First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Blockwill benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988. Braatz expects Block\'s advertising budget to be about thesame as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs fortelevision ads. \"They may get a little more bang for theirbuck,\" he said. He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on itsbalance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it couldbe of great benefit to them. Reuter',1 EARN}

{0 'U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for ashowdown between protectionists and free traders as a majortrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by thefull House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices. This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year\'s record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products. On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegianceto free trade, said the bill ties Reagan\'s hands too much intrade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiatingpowers. Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee\'sbill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse inall respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus amongtrade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicanswould ultimately endorse. Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, \"to make ourtrade policy stronger without violating our international tradeagreements. You\'ll find a lot of people who think we have notdone the former enough. You\'ll find poeple who think we haven\'tavoided violating agreements.\" In a key concession made at the urging of the powerfulchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the tradesubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forcedReagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on importsfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it wouldhurt the U.S. economy. Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an IllinoisDemocrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary ifthe House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of atough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and thisyear only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when hesaw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill. As an indication of his success, White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration stilldid not like some provisions. But he added, \"Generally we feelvery good about the bipartisan consideration of the tradelegislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the fullHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries suchas Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluseswith the United States. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide onlythat the existence of a large trade surplus with the UnitedStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,but would not automatically set off retaliation. Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch freetrader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief fromimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered theadministration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan wouldsign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in astatement, \"I\'m not trying to write legislation to please LaneKirkland. I\'m trying to write legislation that will be signedby the president.\" In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to holdoff his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protectthe domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reaganvetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of themost influential proponents of aid for specific industriesbeset by low priced foreign competition. Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for thedomestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senateplan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when importsreach half of domestic consumption. For the most part, the trade bill\'s provisions toughen U.S.enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administrationto act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such asdumping products in the United States at prices below the costof production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when anindustry complains that a surge in imports threatens itsexistence. Congressmen said the change would have required theU.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on carimports in 1981. Reuter',1 TRADE}

In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accountsreceivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and anotherJapanese distributor during the company\'s 1986 fiscal year. Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operationsit will exhaust all currently available cash and creditfacilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use ofthe remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of creditfrom Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp<CZ>. The company said its ability to obtain funding wasadversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of itsshareholders seeking to represent a class of holders againstthree officers of Endotronics. Endotronics said the complaint against it allegesviolations of the federal securities laws in connection withstatements made in the company\'s annual and quarterly reports.

After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries thismorning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it wouldvote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries. \"Our information suggests we will have the required numberof votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,\"he said. \"The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20years, and dropped every time.

The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fightthe proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account forone-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billiondlrs a year, Bennett said.

{0 'A new method of calculating Sweden\'sunemployment figures reduced the number of jobless by a sixth,a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics (SCB) said,reporting a substantial drop in the past year. According to the revised data there were 94,000 jobless inFebruary representing 2.2 pct of the workforce against 120,000or 2.8 pct of the workforce in February 1986. SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were basedon a more extensive survey of the unemployed which broughtSweden into line with the practises recommended by theGeneva-based International Labour Organisation. Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployedby about 16 pct. \"The way we are now collecting data is far moreaccurate and we are asking many more questions to find outwhether the jobless want work, whether they are able to workand whether they have actually looked for work,\" he toldReuters. The new method was first used for the January figures,which showed unemployment dropping to 2.1 pct of the workforcefrom 2.7 pct (old style) in December, but Wessberg said thechange had apparently not been noticed by the press. Recalculated according to the new method, unemployment inFebruary 1986 would have stood at 2.2 pct, the SCB said. REUTER',1 JOBS}
{0 'The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world moneymarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stabilityin Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,which holds eight European Community currencies within narrowfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), hasbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alikeseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu asEurope\'s common currency took a step nearer to becoming realitywhen Belgium minted the world\'s first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so farblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system\'sfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt andformer French President Valery Giscard d\'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two yearsafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have beentransferred from national governments and central banks to anautonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty ineconomic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS isthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to asituation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said oneeconomist who has closely watched the system\'s development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy onthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is thesystem\'s greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged andinvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharprise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain\'s failure to lend theEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major worldcurrency, outside the system. No change in the British government\'s attitude is expectedbefore the country\'s next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system\'s last realignment, the 11th since itwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC\'shighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of CentralBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministershold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involvemore than tinkering with technical details. They are scepticalabout the chances for any fundamental change. \"Technical measures won\'t be enough to protect the EMSagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that wemust take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leode Corel of Kredietbank\'s economic research department. Economists say the system\'s fortunes now will dependlargely on the success of an agreement last month among majorindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollarresumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, theypredict. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchangecontrols to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing withEuropean Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for theending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said. \"The measures to take effect by June were designed to liftrestrictions on foreign currency operations, in line withderegulation in the banking industry,\" he said in a telephoneinterview. The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controlshighlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday. The central bank said in a statement the measures includedincreased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provisionfor future pension fund obligations. It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulateSpain\'s financial sector, a move triggered by entry into theCommunity last year. Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, aprocess that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreignbanks to open branches. Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market andthey now control about 15 pct of the system\'s lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreigncurrency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against aprevious ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between thatdate and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into thecountry on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billionpesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would begiven clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreigncurrency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, byissuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreignissues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies,instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on theamount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limitedto three times a bank\'s capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by mostbankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month whichimposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible pesetafunds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place onnormal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreignspeculative capital which is entering the country andthreatening the government\'s money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which nowaccount for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at adisadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirementsto 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact ofinterest rate deregulation. \"The real problem is the freeing ofinterest rates,\" the banker said. \"This is going to take a bigbite out of profits.\" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paidon deposits of up to 180 days.

IBP\'s latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hourfor slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay forprocessing workers. The cut follows the 1.07 dlr cut in payworkers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lastedsince then, Zack said.

{0 'The Belgian government has lowered itsforecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, PrimeMinister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament. He said this revision, which brings government forecastsmore closely into line with those by private institutions,takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economyand international trade. But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will belimited due to recent agreements on wages and workingconditions agreed by employers and unions. Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP togrow in volume terms. However, last month the government\'s Planning Bureau saidit had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0.9 pct from 2.0pct. In 1986, Belgium\'s gross national product rose 2.15 pct involume terms against a 5.9 pct nominal rise. REUTER',1 GNP}

Arango said that government measures adopted here lastweek, including a lower export registration price, indicated amajor change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism. \"This is the start of a new era in Colombia because worldmarket conditions are also new,\" he said. The government lowered local taxes for exporters and saidthe export registration price, or reintegro, will be changedmore often in order to closely reflect market trends. Arango said an illustration of Colombia\'s new attitude wasthe decision on Friday to open export registrations for anunlimited amount. But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavyselling of coffee. \"Our marketing policy is to sell without haste butconsistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will reactto market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention ofgiving its coffee away.\" Colombia\'s past records should be the basis for upcomingexports, he said. \"We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags butneither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows fullwell what Colombia\'s export potential is,\" he said. Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags,exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee yearwhich ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986. Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictionsbut said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would notexceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by theNational Coffee Growers\' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S.Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was \"ridiculous.\" He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in thenumber one producing province of Antioquia, meant output waslikely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare andoscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags. On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango saidColombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managedto force a compromise. Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and headof his nation\'s delegation in London, has blamed theintransigence of some big countries, without naming them. However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister CesarGaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United Stateswould undoubtedly be under great political pressure in comingweeks to revise its policy. \"Washington will have to take into account that for manycountries, and some of its allies for instance in CentralAmerica, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would havefar-reaching political and economic consequences.\" Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on exportquotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve whichcould emerge from continuous contacts.

{0 'Belgian Prime Minister WilfriedMartens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs. He said this will enable the requirement to be held to419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product. Martens said following a lowering of government estimatesof 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by governmentdepartments of 1987 spending, the government calculated thatunless action was taken, the requirement would exceed thetarget by 22.5 billion francs. Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receiptsby 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion.The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised throughtreasury operations. Martens said the money is being found through a series ofsmall economies and confirmed that it includes the raising oftwo billion francs through the sale of part of the government\'s50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz. Last year, the government announced a major programdesigned to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs. The program was designed to get Belgium out of what thegovernment said was a \"snowball effect\" under which thegovernment constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficitswhich were due largely to the cost of servicing and repayingexisting debt. In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimatedat 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP. REUTER',1 GNP}
{0 '<Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move uniqueamong Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold globalexpansion that could someday lift the foreign share of itsyearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said. First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analystMichael Walsh said Royal Trust\'s international growth target isattainable. But it \"will be a tremendous achievement because... they\'re going to have to build an international earningsbase larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestictrust companies,\" Walsh said. Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust\'s154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growththis year against an expected 15 pct jump in total companyprofit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview. He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990. Royal Trust, Canada\'s second largest trust company withassets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operatedinternationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank. Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, whenother Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings andloans, were focusing on domestic retail banking. The company\'s overseas ambitions were whetted by heighteneddomestic competition and impressive growth at its London bankoperations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,Cornelissen said. Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe andAsia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow ChemicalCo <DOW>\'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included assetmanagement, merchant and private banking companies. \"It was a heaven-sent opportunity,\" Cornelissen said of theDow Financial acquisition. \"We achieved in one year what wouldotherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.\" Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun directcompetition with major global financial institutions inactivities such as international lending and stock brokerage,in order to exploit \"profitable niches\" overseas in traditionaltrust activities such as asset management, private banking andadvisory services. He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations\"before the end of this month\" to sell its London-based SavoryMilln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal. \"The international market is so big and we have such aminiscule share of it that growth opportunities are reallylimited only by our energy and our desire to find morebusiness,\" he said, adding that in trust-type services, \"wedon\'t think the international markets are well-served.\" Aiding Royal Trust\'s foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadianinvestment abroad, Cornelissen said. Central to Royal Trust\'s strategy is Asia, boasting rapideconomic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, saidCornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billiondlrs, more than any other Canadian trust. Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asiawill contain two-thirds of the world\'s population and 50 pct ofglobal productive capacity, Cornelissen said, \"We knew we hadto be there.\" Royal Trust\'s 14 international locations includeoffices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company alsorecently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Royal Trust president said the company was stressinggrowth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee anyacquisitions in the \"immediate future,\" although \"we have oureyes wide open for the right opportunities.\" Asked about Royal Trust\'s plans for the U.S., which thecompany abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market wellcovered by hundreds of small regional banks. \"That doesn\'t mean to say we shouldn\'t be in the U.S.,\"said Cornelissen. \"That is probably one area that we willprobably do something with in the next five years.\" He said the company would continue to emphasize its homeCanadian market, which Cornelissen and financial servicesanalysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust. Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation inone another\'s actitivies will mean more domestic competitionfor Royal Trust, \"but not drastically more,\" Cornelissen said.

{0 'Salomon Brothers Inc said it raisedits opinion on Caterpillar Inc\'s stock to an aggressive buyfrom a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988. Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecastof three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at2.50 dlrs to three dlrs. Caterpillar\'s stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4. \"Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,we believe that profits could begin to improve in the secondhalf - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through1988 and 1989,\" he said.

{0 'Norway\'s parliament has approved anextensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners akey loophole through which controversial oil shipments onNorwegian tankers may continue, government officials said. The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway\'s minorityLabour government, gives domestic companies until lateSeptember to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa andNamibia. \"The legislation discussed today must not be seen as anisolated measure, but as a step in an international process,\"Norway\'s foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament. Government officials said they hope the move will intensifyinternational pressure against the Pretoria regime\'s apartheidpolicies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to haltall trade with South Africa by October. Norway\'s boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipmentsto South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an importantexception for ships whose final destination is decided whilethey are at sea. Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading,making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships\' finalport at the start of a voyage. Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continuedoil shipments to South Africa. They called for strictersanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa. Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pctof its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade hasdropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,trade ministry officials said. The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from SouthAfrica dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eightmonths of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crownsfrom the year-ago figure. \"Many would say that the law has already had its effectbecause of the dramatic drop in trade between South African andNorway,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters. \"Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuringits relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law. \"No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect oninternational trade with South Africa, but it is an importantpolitical statement by the Norwegian government,\" he said.

{0 'Finance Minister Palle Simonsen saidtoday\'s downgrading of Denmark\'s credit rating by Standard andPoor\'s Corp should not be over-dramatised. Standard and Poor\'s said it had downgraded the Kingdom ofDenmark\'s long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, followingthe country\'s loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983. \"This change is regrettable but there is no reason todramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor\'sdefines the AA category as only slightly different from the topAAA rating,\" Simonsen said in a statement. \"The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowingcapability is unlikely to be very great. But if, againstexpectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external accountdeficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms andcapability,\" he added. \"Standard & Poor\'s has noted that in 1986 there was a seriesof austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending andencourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect. \"If and when it becomes necessary, the government will beready to take any necessary economic and political initiativesas it has in the past,\" Simonsen said. Standard and Poor\'s said weaker internationalcompetitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean adeteriorating current account balance and a rise in externaldebt. The external current account deficit rose to a recordpreliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns,according to government statistics.

{0 'U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for ashowdown between protectionists and free traders as a majortrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by thefull House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices. The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year\'s record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Generally, the bill\'s provisions toughen U.S. enforcementof trade laws. The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly oncomplaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping productsin the United States at prices below cost of production. Italso forces the administration to act rapidly when an industrycomplains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products. But congressmen known for their allegiance to free tradesaid the bill ties Reagan\'s hands too much in trade disputesand they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee\'s bill was notone \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\"but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to worktoward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policystronger without violating our international trade agreements,\"he said. In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and MeansCommittee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the tradesubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forcedReagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on importsfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation ifit would hurt the U.S. economy. Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach wasnecessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would signinto law. Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a toughHouse trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year heonly reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he sawDemocratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters latelast week that the administration still did not like some ofthe bill\'s provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel verygood about the bipartisan consideration of the tradelegislation. I think we are progressing very well.\" The first battle will take place next week when the fullHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, SouthKorea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide onlythat the existence of a large trade surplus with the UnitedStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,but would not automatically set off retaliation. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief fromimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered theadministration when he said any trade bill Reagan would signwould not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate bysaying, \"I\'m not trying to write legislation to please LaneKirkland. I\'m trying to write legislation that will be signedby the president.\" Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a billto protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aidesaid. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the mostinfluential proponents of aid for specific industries beset bylow-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call forimport relief for the domestic oil industry and announced hissupport for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil importtariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.

Unless there was an early improvement in developingcountries\' terms of trade \"the only choice is to follow theroute that Brazil appears to have taken,\" Tesfay said.

Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiationof recent commodity agreements. The failure of the International Coffee Organisation toagree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean \"severalAfrican countries will not have the foreign exchange to importessential items,\" he said. Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and therecent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced thecountry\'s foreign exchange earnings. Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N.Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there wasan increasing net outflow of resources from Africa. He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing andthe repatriation of profits by foreign investors. Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreigndebt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expectedto rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said. He accused industrialised countries of failing to providemore resources to implement the U.N.

Moreover, Fairchild\'s management is thought to beconsidering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,Calif., company, analysts said. In a brief statement announcing the termination of theagreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision openedup other possibilities, including a possible buyout byFairchild management. The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu wouldhave bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,because rising opposition to the deal by the Reaganadministration made it unlikely that the sale could becompleted within a reasonable period of time. Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing thatthe companies did not need government approval to complete thetransaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-ownedcompanies. \"Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal becausethe U.S. government didn\'t want it,\" said Johnson of L.F.Rothschild. A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on thecompany\'s news release. He said only that the company was reviewing a number ofpossible alternatives for the Fairchild unit. Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediatelyavailable for comment. Analysts noted the significance of the government\'sapparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control ofFairchild.

{0 'Corporate raider Carl Icahnacknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigationby the Securities and Exchange Commission into possibleviolations of securities laws. Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc<TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required tomake with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group. The SEC issued a formal order launching the privateinvestigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing. The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find outwhether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities lawsand related rules, Icahn said. Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition andsubsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certainunspecified companies, he said. Federal law requires individuals or groups of individualswho have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes incompanies of at least five pct within 10 days. Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed inconnection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he hasdisclosed that he is among those being investigated. By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which isobviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was alsoalerting current and potential shareholders of TWA. It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that theyor their officers are the targets of government probes toacknowledge the existence of the otherwise secretinvestigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirementsto their shareholders. Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and otherswhom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring andselling more than five pct of a company\'s stock. SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securitieslaw violations have been spawned by the agency\'s widening probeinto the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according topublished reports. Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amountof stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or makingno filing at all could indicate a scheme to \"warehouse\" sharesof stock. In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting inconcert would each amass stock in the company withoutdisclosing that they have an agreement among them. By failing to disclose that they are acting together themarket is unware of the amount of stock of a company that iscontrolled by a group acting in concert. Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzbergfamily of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme whileit was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc. Reuter',1 ACQ}

The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extracash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levelsand to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption bymaking it more competitive with other oils. Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oilproducers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by thetax. \"What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be betterunderstood not just outside the community but at home,\" he said.

National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out ofsavings from another plan to curb milk production. Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by thescheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massivesurpluses built up before they joined the community last year,but the two countries did not block today\'s vote.

{0 'Japan\'s overall wholesale price index(base 1980) fell 0.1 pct in February from a month earlier to86.4 for the second consecutive month-on-month fall, the Bankof Japan said. Wholesale prices fell 0.6 pct in January from December. The index fell 9.1 pct from a year earlier for the 21ststraight year-on-year drop, the central bank said. The reduced month-on-month drop mainly stemmed from therecovery in world crude oil prices, it said. On a customs-cleared basis, crude oil prices rose to around17 dlrs a barrel in February from about 15 dlrs in January. The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 0.8pct to 153.50 in February from 154.67 in January and was up16.8 pct from 184.55 a year earlier, the bank said. The export price index in February fell 0.7 pct from amonth earlier reflecting price cuts in export products likecars and precision instruments due to severe foreigncompetition. The index was down 7.1 pct from a year earlier. The import price index rose 1.1 pct from a month earlier to57.4 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due tothe continued strength of world crude oil prices. But the indexwas down 29 pct from a year earlier. The domestic price index fell 0.1 pct to 91.9 in February,its 24th straight monthly drop, mainly reflecting falls inprices of home appliances such as colour televisions due tosevere sales competition at home. Lower edible oil prices addedto the decline. The index was down 6.7 pct from a year earlier. The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of7.1 pct in January since the central bank started compilingsuch statistics in 1960 under its current system. Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March ashigher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected,the bank said. REUTER',1 WPI}

The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable ataround 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at ameeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.

Dealers generally doubted whether any economic packageJapan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce itstrade surplus significantly, and said such measures wouldprobably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package ofmeasures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boostdomestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an oppositionboycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed impositionof a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slimchance of producing a meaningful economic package in the nearfuture, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in theU.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure onthe dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changedsince before the Paris accord, they added. \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due toa still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debtcrisis triggered by Brazil\'s unilateral suspension of interestpayments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of theReagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra armsscandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline toaround 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical BankTokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.

De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,\"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within theCommunity concerning trade relations with Japan.\" The EC is not satisfied with Japan\'s inability to cut itstrade surplus, and the Commission has adopted a tough approachon imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers, where it hasimposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties. But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyoto solve the problem rather than embark on a costly anddamaging trade war, and the ministers called for morecooperation with Japan in industry and research.

{0 'Buoyed by low fuel prices andfavourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd\'s<CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline\'sforecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said. Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earningsof between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reportsresults tomorrow for its first year as a public company. Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, madeits earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation inMay last year. Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, makinga total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in theprospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said. They said the airline\'s performance improved in the secondhalf of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mlndlrs. The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to oneU.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company\'sfavour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the timeof the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said. James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airlineindustry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices wouldaffect Cathay\'s net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profitsof 1.25 billion dlrs. Analysts said the company\'s estimates of fuel price andcurrency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative. \"This is reflected in their interim results which showedthat profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang ofMansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Cathay\'s six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlierlevels, but profits rose 69 pct. The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact onthe company\'s fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel pricesusually lag behind crude price movements by several months,analysts said. By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against theHong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct andsterling 12 pct. \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar againstCathay\'s major trading currencies helped push passenger yieldsin the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This shouldcontinue through the second half to enable passenger yields toend the year up 7.6 pct.\" A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cashunder management also improved profits, James Capel said. A general improvement in air traffic last year contributedto Cathay\'s revenue increase, but the company\'s load factordeclined because of increased competition and an expansion ofits fleet and services. James Capel estimated Cathay\'s passenger-kilometres flownlast year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flownclimbed 17 pct, though the airline\'s load factor probably fellto 68.8 pct from 70 pct. \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routeslast year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\"said Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\" Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier <HongKong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay\'sdecision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analystssaid.

Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, whichis an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present itsown reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court. Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reservesand pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for anundisclosed amount. TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company valuesits total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at aboutone billion dlrs. The company, the second-largest natural gas producer inTexas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet andover 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines. About 80 pct of TransAmerican\'s gas is available for spotmarket sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.

The newspaper said the inter-agency government study founda serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily fallingdomestic production and rising demand for imported oil. The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relyingon foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peakof 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate duringthe 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.

{0 'China\'s grain imports will risein 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, butwill be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials andJapanese traders told Reuters. They said foreign exchange constraints and national policywould not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peakedat 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982. An agricultural official of the Shanghai government putmaximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985. Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poorharvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports,which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985. \"China is short of foreign exchange,\" the Shanghai officialsaid. \"We cannot rely on imports, even at current low worldprices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become amajor importer.\" A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain importswould rise and exports fall this year because of the drought,low world prices and rising domestic demand for human andanimal consumption. \"At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grainit exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badlyneeds,\" the trader said. The People\'s Daily said last Saturday a serious drought isaffecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reducethe summer grain harvest from last year\'s level. The paper added that leaders in some areas were not payingenough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making itdifficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mlntonnes against 391 mln in 1986. \"All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvestarea, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice andhigh-yield cash crops,\" it said. It added factory production might have to be reduced toprovide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fightthe drought. Since January, the press has devoted much attention tograin, stressing that growth in output is vital to China\'seconomic and political stability and that prices paid tofarmers are too low. Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grainproduction is a key state policy and outlined the measuresbeing taken in their areas to encourage output. The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct ofthe pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidiseagriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also setaside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the70,000 workers available to help farmers. Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outsideShanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and threeyears unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits. Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department ofZhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grainoutput in his province. \"In addition, we are setting up grain production bases,raising the level of science and technology on the farms andimproving the supply of raw materials, roads and otherinfrastructure,\" he said. The Shanghai official said rural residents who work inindustry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in theirspare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases,they lease the land to grain farmers. The China Daily said last month that grain output shouldreach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be madeprofitable. \"The advantages the state promises grain growers actuallyyield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off byintermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.Only this will boost enthusiasm,\" it said.

{0 'Schlumberger Ltd\'s <SLB.N> decision toend an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> to buy80 pct of its <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, and the politicalfurore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanesecompanies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. Hightechnology firms but will not halt such attempts, industryanalysts said. The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow toFujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion bythe Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters. \"The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu\'sNorth American operations, but it would have been a greatboost,\" James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said. French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was endingthe agreement because mounting political controversy in theU.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stakecould be completed in a reasonable time. The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department andDefence Department, partly on national security grounds. Fujitsu\'s acquisition of Fairchild would have given theJapanese computer maker control of a comprehensive NorthAmerican sales and distribution system and access tomicroprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,analysts said. The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additionalmicrochip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in theU.S., A report by the Capel firm said. \"It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and amarketing channel for other things,\" said Barclays de Zoete Weddanalyst Rick May. Several analysts said the purchase would not have givenFujitsu access to critical defence technology. \"(Fairchild) simply doesn\'t have key technology -- that\'s athing of the past,\" May said. The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu asit might have had to spend several hundred million dollars tomodernise Fairchild\'s production lines, Capel\'s Murtha said. The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanesefirms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. Hightech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said. Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costlyroute of expanding its own production and distributionfacilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use theestimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try toacquire some less politically symbolic firm. \"It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but thenecessity of expanding their production and design capacity inAmerica remains,\" said Capel\'s Murtha. \"The Japanese willcontinue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to findones that are politically acceptable.\" Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures orsmaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlashthat blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. \"They\'re notgoing to slow up, they\'re just going to buy smaller pieces ...Because of the political risk,\" said Barclays de Zoete\'s May. Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pctshares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as superminicomputer makers, he said. Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end upharming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinationaltie-ups, some analysts said. \"This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either,\" saidJardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. \"Thepooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move --why should the government step in to prevent it?\" Japan\'s Minister of International Trade and Industry HajimeTamura told a press conference that interference by U.S.Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate. \"This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matterfor governments\' comment,\" Tamura said. \"I think it was improperfor U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent theydid,\" he said. A spokesman told Reuters the ministry\'s view is thatinternational investment flows ought to be free and that suchflows are of increasing importance in line with the growingcloseness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.

Kaunda said that once preparations had beencompleted for evacuating Zambia\'s mineral exports on safe anddependable routes his government would look to increase itsusage of TAZARA for other types of cargo. The 1986 annual report of Zambia\'s state-run MetalMarketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country\'s metalexports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fellto 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985. Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia\'sexport routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressedreservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beiraports to handle all of Zambia\'s mineral exports, even if theycould be hauled there by train. \"The two ports cannot in any way and in their present formhandle the huge exports of Zambian copper,\" one western diplomatsaid. \"A serious disruption in copper movement to the marketscould be brought about as it would pile up at the two portswhich lack the facilities and space to handle the coppertonnage,\" he added.

U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanesemicrochip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell atbelow cost in markets outside Japan and the United States. The agreement, signed last September, aimed at haltingpredatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S.Semiconductor firms\' access to the Japanese market. The comments by MITI officials followed a call by PrimeMinsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings onthe U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said. Yukio Honda, director of MITI\'s Industrial ElectronicsDivision, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at belowcost in third countries. MITI\'s call to Japanese chip makers last month to cutproduction of key memory chips in the first quarter of thisyear has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale inthe non-regulated grey market, Honda said. \"The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, butin contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expandingmarket share because of their cheaper prices,\" Honda said. MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excesssupply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after thepact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductorexports to the United States, he added. The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelinesfor the second quarter and suggested production volumes arelikely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said.

{0 'Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japantakes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Parisaccord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealerat one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable ataround 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at ameeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewedinflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic packageJapan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce itstrade surplus significantly, and said such measures wouldprobably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package ofmeasures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boostdomestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an oppositionboycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed impositionof a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slimchance of producing a meaningful economic package in the nearfuture, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in theU.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure onthe dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changedsince before the Paris accord, they added. \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due toa still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debtcrisis triggered by Brazil\'s unilateral suspension of interestpayments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of theReagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra armsscandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline toaround 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical BankTokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either wayfor fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask forquotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollarwhen it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in Londonwhen it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of centralbank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar\'s declinebecause many dealers are likely to await such dollar buyingintervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branchassistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will notshow drastic movement at least to the end of March.\" Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see anystrong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their booksfor the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollarwould give Japanese institutional investors paper losses ontheir foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest inpurchases of U.S. Treasury securities.

{0 'The Japanese economy will remain sluggishin the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for12 years in 1986, private economists said. Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing andbusiness investment would help sustain the economy this year,the economists said. They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agencyreport today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Decquarter for the first time in 12 years. The report said Japan\'s gross national product rose a real0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in theprevious quarter. It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worstperformance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wakeof the first oil crisis. They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline inconsumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it wasonly temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather haddepressed retail sales. But most private economists disagreed and said consumerswere likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they sawtheir real income level off. \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes orheating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, butthey have done so because they have become even more uneasyabout their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general managerof Mitsui Bank\'s economic research division. He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hithard by the yen\'s rise. Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, saidweakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor.Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achievedomestically generated economic growth as the government hasput a lid on fiscal measures, he said. Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered inOct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, includingexceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. JohsenTakahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Decresulted from an issue of gold coins. \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can\'t expect thathigh level of public-sector consumption in the followingquarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spendingwould have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, whichmarked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito\'s reign. Takahashi said the economy might contract in the currentquarter given the lack of additional significant governmentspending and sluggish consumer spending.

The statement added that, due to technical market promotionand energetic sales by Chile and Peru, the stock position atthe end of the year remained reasonable. Fish meal production outside South America decreasedslightly, falling from 114,400 to 111,100 tonnes. The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in WestGermany, Scandinavian countries, Eastern Europe and the FarEast, but fell in the U.S. And remained static in the U.K. It added that fish meal consumption had suffered fromcompetition with feed grade tallow in the U.S. And with skimmedmilk powder in the U.K. IAFMM figures for fish oil production in the main producingnations, in thousands of tonnes, were - Oct/Dec Jan/Dec 1986 1985 1986 1985 CHILE 22 8 109 76 PERU 56 28 238 104 NORWAY 14 14 97 130 ICELAND 44 52 102 118 DENMARK 20 18 88 77 U.S. 10 8 152 129 JAPAN 67 91 213 249 REUTER',1 MEAL-FEED}
{0 'Copper shares, which have laggedbehind the market, should pick up steam this year on strongerdemand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said. \"Copper prices should move up over the next four to sixquarters,\" said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co <MER>. \"Isee average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up fromaround 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued worldeconomic growth.\" Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts apound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988. Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp <PD> will be a strongperformer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer. But Asarco Inc <AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales fromcopper, and Newmont Mining Corp <NEM> are also potentialwinners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of itscopper operations to its shareholders. \"In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It\'s the purest playand benefits most from higher copper prices,\" one said. William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co,said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined miningoperations. \"They\'ve accomplished a great deal,\" he said. The company\'s move into carbon black, a product used intires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapidgrowth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said.He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrsin 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986. Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean WitterReynolds Inc and Merrill\'s Roling, also recommend Phelps. Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 andfour dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs thisyear and around 3.50 dlrs next year. \"The stock can go to the mid 30s,\" Roling said, from itscurrent level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40. \"Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don\'t needcopper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money,\" saidVahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. \"The shares willoutperform the market over the next 18 months,\" he said. But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc saysNewmont Mining is a more attractive investment. \"We\'d ratherplace our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see asignificant premium to the current stock price,\" he said. After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont willhave gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co<NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations,Toufexis noted. Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40dlrs from operations in 1986. \"I\'d be buying up to 90,\" Toufexis said last week, when thestock rose sharply to near that level. \"But the shares areprobably worth about 108 dlrs (each).\" Dean Witter\'s Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball likeAsarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrisonsees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against lossesin 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 andfrom three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988. Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co<CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests incoal and other minerals aside from copper. But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpricedat current levels. \"I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buyPhelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock,\" he said. Reuter',1 COPPER}

{0 'The European Community (EC) yesterdaywarned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners,that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC\'s relationswith both countries. EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan\'scontinued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to makea greater effort to open up its markets. They also said theywere disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress thatwould impose permanent quotas on textile imports and wereprepared to react. The U.S. Administration has alreadydistanced itself from the bill. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has writtento his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,outlining the EC\'s concerns. The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.Moves towards protectionism. \"The adoption of such measureswould not fail to have a negative effect on the process ofmultilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateralrelations,\" it said. Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option butto react according to the laws of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, it said. In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers saidthey \"deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance intrade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.\" The statement said the EC would continue to insist thatJapan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand. Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare areport on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable themto take appropriate action where necessary. One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministerswere determined not to let the Japanese question drop. \"It willbe back on the table again and again,\" the diplomat said. De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,\"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within theCommunity concerning trade relations with Japan.\" But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyoto solve the problem rather than embark on a costly anddamaging trade war, and the ministers called for morecooperation with Japan in industry and research.

{0 'The western industrialised nations haveagreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit forexports to developing countries, the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development said. The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid tosubsidise export credits in so-called \"mixed credits,\" the OECDsaid. The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July thisyear and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixedcredits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct forcredits covering exports to the world\'s least developednations. Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculatingthe aid element in mixed credits, to take account of differentinterest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,which hosted the reform negotiations, said. Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised tradeloans have also been revised with the aim of cutting thesubsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relativelyrich developing countries by July next year. The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. Tostop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aidto subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage. OECD officials said the agreement was based on aprovisional accord reached in January subject to ratificationby member governments. Some governments, including Austria, hadlinked their final approval to other trade credit issues whichwould be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added. By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixedcredits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies toocostly for frequent use. \"A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade has been closed today,\" a senior U.S. Official herecommented.

{0 'Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance ofpayments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of thisyear, Lawson said. \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation maycontinue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct bythe summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of theyear,\" he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range forthe narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3aggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be takeninto account in assessing monetary conditions, as of coursewill the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"ischiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil taxrevenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by anincreasingly profitable business sector in particular.\" On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlierassumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs perbarrel in calendar 1987. He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil taxrevenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of theeconomy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts thepublic finances in a very strong position.\" Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at1.0 pct of GDP in future. \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium TermFinancial Strategy\'s) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the yearsahead,\" Lawson said. \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have thisyear for reducing the burden of taxation, which of courseremains a major objective of government policy.\" \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudenceand caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\" Lawson said the time had come to strike the ExchangeControl Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchangedat 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies\' capital gains will becharged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\" He said that under the new proposed system, companiesshould be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) paymentsagainst tax on capital gains. \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in1988/89,\" Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and buildingsocieties be treated the same way on payment of corporationtax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months afterthe end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\" \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a newmethod of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay andFile.\" This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining taxcollection, and would not come into force until the early1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax(PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pctof the costs of developing certain new fields set against their(PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of thosenew fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spendingon research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to anyparticular field. On business employment, Lawson said employers will receivetax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future, traders registered for ValueAdded Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the taxon the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead ofquarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was beingextended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholdsare to be raised to 21,300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now beset at 125,000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companiesin multinational groups with dual residence will no longer beable to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but \"genuinetrading companies\" will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax creditrelief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bankloans, also from April 1. \"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax creditonly against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,\" he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by twopence, to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government\'s aim of reducing basictaxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added \"given my decisionto use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have toreduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.\" Small companies\' corporation tax is also being reduced to27 pct, he said. On the Lloyd\'s insurance market, Lawson said he planned tochange the tax treatment of Lloyd\'s syndicates, bringing itinto line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilitiesmade by ordinary insurance companies and of comparableprovisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently withLloyd\'s about the details of the legislation, he said. \"The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for theLloyd\'s account which closes on December 31 this year,\" Lawsonsaid.
