{0 'Showers continued throughout the week inthe Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since earlyJanuary and improving prospects for the coming temporao,although normal humidity levels have not been restored,Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bagsof 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seemsthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in thearrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to howmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting haspractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimatesaround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln thereare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fitfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties inobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers havesold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment andonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports withJune/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrsunder New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrsper tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/Julyat 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs forMarch/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 timesNew York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertiblecurrency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times NewYork July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New YorkSept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smithsaid. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bagsagainst the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected tobe published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission aftercarnival which ends midday on February 27. Reuter',1 COCOA}

The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrsat 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-weekstatement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing thatthere were no large single day net misses in the Fed\'s reserveprojections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been \"acting a bitstrangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had beenpoor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, tonearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday\'s highfloat, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday\'sfloat figure was due to holdover and transportation float attwo widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as ofadjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections forunrelated cash letter errors in six districts around thecountry. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, twodifferent clearing banks had system problems and the securitiesand Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up duringboth afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserveimpact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discountwindow borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pctby the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regionalinstitutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for bythe money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excessreserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit onFriday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily averagedeficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period, he said there were relatively highexcess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were atthe smallest banks. Reuter',1 MONEY-SUPPLY}
{0 'American Express Co remained silent onmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may beconsidering such a move because it is unhappy with the marketvalue of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as themarket calculated a partially public Shearson may command agood market value, thereby boosting the total value of AmericanExpress. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financialservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or itsstock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts\'meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcementyesterday of management changes. At the meeting, company officials said American Expressstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performanceof Shearson, according to analysts. Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chiefoperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position ofpresident, which had been vacant. It also created four newpositions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make mostsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a totalspinoff. Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff ofShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center forAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings lastyear. \"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express isgoing to sell shearson,\" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.He questioned what would be a better investment than \"a veryprofitable securities firm.\" Several analysts said American Express is not in need ofcash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strongasset. But others believe the company could very well ofconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and onerumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said hebelieves American Express could have considered a partialspinoff in the past. \"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched abig premium in the market place. Shearson\'s book value is inthe 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place wouldprobably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of marketcapitalization,\" said Eckenfelder. Some analysts said American Express could use capital sinceit plans to expand globally. \"They have enormous internal growth plans that takescapital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations toenhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down theroad,\" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis. \"They\'ve outlined the fact that they\'re investing heavilyin the future, which goes heavily into the internationalarena,\" said Lewis. \"...That does not preclude acquisitions anddivestitures along the way,\" he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to thebrokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock mightbetter reflect other assets, such as the travel relatedservices business. \"It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposureto brokerage. The value of the other components could command ahigher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage ofthe total operating earnings of the company,\" he said. Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-taxoperating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter',1 ACQ}

{0 'A study on grain certificates due outshortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could showthat certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more thancash outlays, administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the AgricultureDepartment and the Office of Management and Budget suggeststhat certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO officialtold Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specificrequest of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of thesenate agriculture committee. The report, which will focus on the cost of certificatescompared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends onthe program\'s impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loanentries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost ofthe program would go up. However, if it is determined thatcertificates have caused the government grain stockpile todecrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificatesprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fireagainst certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increasein the certificate program,\" an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,while USDA remains firmly committed to it. Reuter',1 GRAIN}

They may need an emergency meeting to sort outthe problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPECfaces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. \"OPEC\'s problem is not a price problem but a productionissue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oilanalyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market\'s earlier optimism about OPEC and itsability to keep production under control have given way to apessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon ifit wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even anemergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC productionabove the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot havedeemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said theregional manager for one of the major oil companies who spokeon condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying toteach them that lesson again,\" he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPECto meet before June, although not immediately. However, he isnot optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. \"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of thewinter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and Aprilwhen demand slackens,\" Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything morethan reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.\" Analysts said that the next two months will be critical forOPEC\'s ability to hold together prices and output. \"OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weekssince buyers will come back into the market then,\" said DillardSpriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University\'s Energyand Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oilhas been rising through the first quarter and this may haveprompted excesses in its production. \"Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpdand is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what weare seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting thisdemand through current production,\" he told Reuters in atelephone interview.

{0 'Liquefied natural gas imports fromAlgeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though itseconomically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said. Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerianstate petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview inAlgiers that such imports would be made this year. \"Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government andthe time required to restart mothballed terminals will delaythe import until 1988/1989,\" Daniel Tulis, a natural gasanalyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its formercustomers, Panhandle Eastern <PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiaryof Cabot Corp <CBT> to resume LNG export, company officialstold Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of BurlingtonNorthern <BNI>, has expressed no interest. Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG werefeasible. \"On a marginal cost basis, the companies that havemade capital investment to handle LNG import can operateprofitably even in the current price environment,\" FrankSpadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said. Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian importson U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trendhigher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf ofMexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firmprices, Shearson\'s Tulis said. In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source ofsupplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added. Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand. Company sources also said that any negotiations withAlgeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relatevolumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot marketvalues.

{0 'Switzerland\'s economy, combining lowunemployment, financial stability and a large external paymentssurplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactoryfuture, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment, OECD, said. This reflected the success of stable and relatively tightfiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, itsaid. The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked outsome signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up ininflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern. The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Productgrowth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct afterlast year\'s sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modestincrease in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rateunchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrialnation OECD area. Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs tothe dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pctrise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pctrespectively in 1986. The faster growth of imports compared with exports thisyear and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meantthat the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDPwould shrink in both years. But \"given Switzerland\'s large external surplus, thereshould be no concern if domestic demand grows faster thanGDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute toimproving international balances,\" the OECD said. Real private consumption appeared to have been unusuallybuoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after severalyears of relative weakness, it noted. In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhatto a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overallGDP, it added. The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remainedbright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levelslast year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisationin both the industry and service sectors, it said. As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipmentinvestment is likely to decelerate only slightly this yearafter vigorous growth in 1986. But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects fortourism and the banking industry, two major service sectorearners of foreign exchange. The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and theaccelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, couldlead to a loss of international market share for both, it said. Particularly for the banks, \"recent developments ininternational financial markets give rise to the questionwhether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantialflexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speedrequired ...

{0 'The sharp decline in soybean crush ratiosseen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, haspushed margins below the cost of production at most soybeanprocessing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybeanmeal and oil. The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by theNational Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen overthe past two months when crush margins surged to the bestlevels seen in over a year. Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushedsoybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in theweekly crush number. However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surgein shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the nextfew months. U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feeddemand is very light for this time of year due to the milderthan normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices inan attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said. Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recentweeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in thenearby March contract today. \"Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and soldMay, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,which would cause March to gain on deferreds),\" one CBT crushtrader said. \"But they\'ve been bailing out this week because the Marchhas been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if nottomorrow, then later in the month,\" he added. As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crushratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents perbushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last twodays. The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so noprocessors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitablelevel, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cutback production to get supplies in line with demand, he added. With futures down, processors are finding they must bidpremiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins. A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 centsfor every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, downsharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and belowthe average cost of production, cash dealers said.

{0 'Latest Federal Reserve data suggest thatthe central bank voted to maintain the existing degree ofpressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-makingmeeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. \"The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think wecan take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing hadchanged,\" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committeelast Thursday that the Fed\'s policy \"has been unchanged up totoday.\" Although Volcker\'s statement last Thursday allayed mostfears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip onreserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wantedconfirmation of a steady policy in today\'s data, which coveredthe two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the moreacute by the Fed\'s decision yesterday to drain reserves fromthe banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchaseagreements for the first time since April of last year,economists added. Today\'s data showed that the draining action was for afairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. \"The one thing that caught my eye were the relativelysizeable matched sales on Wednesday,\" said Dana Johnson ofFirst National Bank of Chicago. \"But there was a clearlyjustified need for them. There was nothing ominous.\" \"The Fed couldn\'t have waited until the start of the newstatement period today. If it had, it would have missed its(reserve) projections,\" added Security Pacific\'s Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no largesingle-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed\'s discountwindow, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,compared with many economists\' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, thedaily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from160 in the prior period. \"There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday andWednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings,\" saidScott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesdayaverage rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was arelatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in thelatest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves inthe banking system, economists said. \"For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said Darwin Beck ofFirst Boston Corp. \"I expect it to continue in that vein.\" \"Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billiondlrs,\" added First Chicago\'s Johnson. Banks\' excess reservesaveraged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statementperiod, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth rangeto the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, littleattention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billiondlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread afine line between the dollar\'s progress in the internationalcurrency markets and the development of the domestic economy. \"The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar\'s effect onFed policy,\" said First Chicago\'s Johnson. \"Of course, it willtake the dollar into account in future policy decisions but ifthe economy is weak, it won\'t pull back from easing.\" Reuter',1 MONEY-SUPPLY}
{0 'France\'s right wing government is facinggrowing pressure to modify its economic policies after revisingdown its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflationforecasts for this year. Moving reluctantly into line with most private sectorforecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflationestimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut itseconomic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget lastseptember. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figureswould not push the government off its chosen mix of pricederegulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint. But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they wouldpush to protect the purchasing power of their members, raisingthe spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises. And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believedPrime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growthand rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidentialelections due by April 1988. \"The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\"said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. \"We have theimpression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growththis year.\" \"The big question is whether the government\'s policy of wagemoderation will be maintained,\" he added. The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for risesjustified by increased productivity. But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, EdmondMaire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands alreadyrejected by the government for indexation clauses to be builtinto future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higherprices. Calling the government\'s policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" healso demanded investment incentives to boost employment. Heannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him thegovernment would spend two billion francs on a series ofmeasures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderateForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chiracearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest ofFrance\'s unions, declared the defence of its members earningsits top priority. But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, andstill rising, government supporters and some economic analystssaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands. \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialistgovernment and I dont think this administration is going toreverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist atrecently-privatised Banque Paribas. Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmasand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higherinflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, hesaid. Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even morethan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent. \"But that would still be an exceptional achievementconsidering that for the first time since the Second World Warall french prices have been freed,\" he commented. Finance Ministry officials said that the governmentsabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsiblefor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January livingcosts. But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that shouldhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year. Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so longas the government kept wages under control. Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally morethan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,INSEE, Marais said. But the second half year should be better,he added. Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be tohelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budgetdeficit, several analysts said. So long as public sector wages are held down, higher ValueAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset aloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower thanexpected growth, they said.

{0 'Japan is expected to cut the base lendingrate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 aspart of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,Finance Ministry sources said. They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust FundBureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits withthe bureau. The bureau channels funds to government financialinstitutions for public works and other official uses, theysaid. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the JapanDevelopment Bank, People\'s Finance Corp and the financecorporations of local public enterprises usually moves intandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said. However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust FundBureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce amarket-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate thedomestic economy, they said. On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cuttheir prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositorsusing the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts andTelecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity ofthe Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.

But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly thisfinancial year and net export growth will provide the totalsource of gdp growth.

Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPACin December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy isbroadly on track, Keating said. \"They indicate that domestic demand has been a little moresluggish than was expected at budget time,\" he said. \"On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by morethan expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growthin domestic production and employment.\" Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflationrate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct. \"Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing ininflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetaryeffects wane,\" he said. Keating said the government expects economic growth to pickup moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise innet exports and a very moderate but positive contribution fromprivate domestic demand.

The moderate rise in economic growth next financial yearshould be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a levelbroadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year. \"The current account deficit will continue to showimprovement in 1987/88,\" Keating said. \"As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recentyears recede further, and given continued effective wagerestraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,\" hesaid.

{0 'Talks on the possibility of reintroducingglobal coffee export quotas have been extended into today, withsparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters wasnot included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop aprolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of howto implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used toregulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement-- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction toa drought which cut Brazil\"s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world\"s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over thequestion of how quotas should be calculated under any futurequota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eightproducing countries was not represented in a contact group offive producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates whichwas set up to facilitate debate. The big producers \"want to have the ball only in their courtand it isn\"t fair,\" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante ofCosta Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotasApril 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quotashares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas beforeSeptember 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazilto retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the exportmarket, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesiasix pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer grouphave tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determinedby availability, using a formula incorporating exportableproduction and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share andColombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quotadistribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposalthat would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement ona quota package. \"Anything is possible at this phase,\" evenadjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on thesupermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as aresult, industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained aboutsteady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so anupswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,they said.

The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks. \"Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain,\" the report says. \"The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels.\" Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as \"wereng\" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.

{0 'Kuwait\"s Oil Minister, in remarkspublished today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPECmeeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in worldoil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the localdaily al-Qabas as saying: \"None of the OPEC members has askedfor such a meeting.\" He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed productionlimits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimateOPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mlnbpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along withthe much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing abovequota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which saidKuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose thatbecause Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the ministersaid. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability toproduce up to 4.0 mln bpd. \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing theirshare, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpdof its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resistingofficial prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a markerof 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levelsthis year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any internationaloil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\" Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs abarrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil becauseof its local and international refining facilities and its owndistribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC\"sdifferentials committee has been postponed until the start ofApril at the request of certain of the body\"s members. Ecuador\"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite saidlast Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assigna lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this attalks this month of opec\"s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, inapparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: \"Weexpected such pressure.

{0 'Indonesia appears to be nearing apolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protectedeconomy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government haslaunched a series of measures over the past nine months toboost exports outside the oil sector and attract newinvestment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leadingprimary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"sfall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue itscurrency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"sgovernment appears to be divided over what direction to leadthe economy. \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard toderegulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\"the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia\"s agriculturalsector, but also reviews the country\"s general economicperformance. It says that while many government officials and advisersare recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strongpressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\" \"This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\"the report says. Indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the WorldBank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics andsteel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced traderestrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986was probably about zero, and the economy may even havecontracted a bit. \"This is the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s,\" the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with apopulation of 168 million, is facing general elections inApril. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvementin the economic outlook. \"For 1987 early indications point to aslightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economicactivity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in exportearnings from the petroleum industry.\" \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weakdomestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, realdeclines in construction and trade, and a reduced level ofgrowth in agriculture,\" the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms iscrucial for the government to get the international lending itsneeds. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balanceof payments support was given partly to help the governmentmaintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. REUTER',1 CRUDE}

The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyalsin the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister SheikhAbdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected tospend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due touncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the governmentdecided to limit recurrent expenditure each month toone-twelfth of the previous fiscal year\'s allocations minus 15pct. He urged heads of government departments and publicinstitutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. Hedid not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed onthe country\'s foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had beenallocated for major projects including housing and publicbuildings, social services, health, education, transport andcommunications, electricity and water, industry andagriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence andsecurity. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: \"Our expectations of positive signsregarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC\'sdetermination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect itswealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the comingyear\'s revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.\" REUTER',1 CRUDE}
{0 'Gulf money markets have grown reasonablywell during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remainto a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <GulfInternational Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank\'s economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulfcapital markets that investors have to relinquish traditionalinvestment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bankaccounts and precious metals. \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled withmore diversified capital market instruments and a change in thedisclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under threecategories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use ofshort-term money market instruments and banks in the region hadfloated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a largeextent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loansand bank facilities and very few companies had made use ofstock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stockexchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establishexchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capitalmarkets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had\"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capitalmarkets in the region.\" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,financial awareness among investors is still lacking andinvestment analysis and corporate reporting standards lackdepth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s promptedinvestors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in someGulf countries and authorities\' apparent reluctance to adoptfinancial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporationof joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be madeavailable to all citizens and institutions of Gulf CooperationCouncil (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, SaudiArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had beentaken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals toown up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depthfrom the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain andthe expansion of securities repurchase regulations in SaudiArabia. But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in SaudiArabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyaldenominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and tradingin Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formalexchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,Azzam said.

Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below thepronounced prices under any circumstance.\" Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free marketprices \"may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)winter season and the glut in the market.\" Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixedprices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel inmid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market pricesare currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia\'sadherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they allwanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is alsoNigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with thepricing agreement. \"We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulatethe operations of the market, but we are satisfied that thefundamentals exist for stable market conditions,\" he said. Kuwait\'s Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, saidin remarks published in the emirate\'s daily Al-Qabas there wereno plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimateOPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along withthe much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing abovequota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing. REUTER',1 CRUDE}

Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auctionsystem would be used to allocate foreign exchange to privatebidders but not to fix the exchange rate. Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of thegovernment\'s shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand. It was suspended when the kwacha\'s rapid devaluation andstrong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossiblefor the government and the private sector, he said. Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. Thekwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.In January 1987 the government was more than two months inarrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, andthe auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchangerate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju\'aymahterminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last monthfrom 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by somecustomers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulfexports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpdfrom 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but notsales from floating storage, which are generally consideredpart of a country\'s output for Opec purposes.

The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the mostexpensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four yearsto defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an armsand chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo<VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco<ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs <SKPS ST>. Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largestshareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB <SKBS ST> andFrederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them. Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, alsomanaged to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenbergcompany, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB <ALFS ST>. During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating onbuilding up their stake in Investor and Providentia to preventany raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs\' position in theelectrical engineering firm ASEA AB <ASEA ST> is also too smallat 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growingspeculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringeinterests to protect its core activities.

{0 'Mine and industry officials frommost member states of the Association of Tin ProducingCountries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit groupexports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, accordingto views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed atcutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now andboosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC accountfor some 65 pct of the world\'s tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an exportquota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000,Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota.However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughlyequal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world\'s leading producer,said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure thatoutput is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year startedMarch 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters thatexcess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 inthe one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curband asked the government not to issue new mining licences. Morethan 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mininglicences only if a six-month review of production trends showedthat local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia\'s Mining and Energy MinisterSubroto has pledged his country\'s support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PTTambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia tostick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this wasclose to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu saidThailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added thiswould not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tinexporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encouragebigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would bepermitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected todisallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessiveproduction, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong toldReuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo,Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year thanits allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Pazthat Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin incalendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis ofOctober 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the statemining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct ofBolivia\'s total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exportsbut added he was confident the goals set by the plan would beachieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said inLagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within itsATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output haddeclined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria\'s output wasless than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries\'export figures every three months using customs documents andmake projections from such data to see if quotas were likely tobe breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely tobreach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfiltheir quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to othermembers at the ATPC\'s discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate withthe ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnesrespectively during the quota period. REUTER',1 TIN}

The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review thewhole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the wayfor American Secretary of State George Schultz\'s one daystop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action toreduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. \"We appreciate their frustration,\" a senior Japanesegovernment official said. \"But we are also frustrated.\" The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slashspending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progressthat has been made and instead emphasizing the problems thatremain when it talks with Congress. \"It would only take five minutes to list theiraccomplishments,\" a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on theeconomic structures of both countries and how they affect thebilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48billion dlrs in Japan\'s favour. On the following two days, the topics will range frommultilateral trade talks under the auspices of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral tradeproblems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheelingdiscussions among senior officials. Tomorrow\'s topics includesavings and investment issues such as consumer credit andhousing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for theJapanese government, which is facing increasing domesticpressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy andstimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention ofboosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the hugeU.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the tradeimbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Isbuying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a drafttrade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserialtrade practices. \"It condemns Japan without due process,\" oneJapanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-outbill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration\'strade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocalaccess to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory tradeaction by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weakbargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade billoverhanging them. \"We have no leverage,\" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaintsabout its trade practices in a variety of fields, includingsuper computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanesesuper computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire topublic institutions like universities which buy thesophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting upinformal bidding procedures easily understood by all potentialsellers, officials said.

According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EChad risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes betweenAugust and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct ofthe EC market if they continue at the same pace.

{0 'American Express Co, rumored to beconsidering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unitthat could improve Shearon\'s access to capital and help it meetbroadening international competition. In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson saidthe actions under consideration are an integral part ofAmerican Express\' worldwide financial services strategy andthat the two companies have been having both internal andexternal discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on thestrategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimatelydecide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that thefinancial services giant was considering a spinoff of part ofShearson and there was speculation it may be consideringselling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said thespeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct ofthe profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had alsoconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan wasconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that itwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesmanwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remainedsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove AmericanExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring itto a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because asimilar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense forAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-ownedbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinningoff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stockprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express\'1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express\' ambitious plans for international growthmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out partof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all ofShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.\"(American) Express is in a position where they can raisecapital if they need to,\" said Larry Eckenfelder ofPrudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization ofShearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer JeffreyLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions forchairmen of Shearson\'s operating divisions, a move analystsspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement doeslittle to clarify last week\'s market speculation. It doesconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, whichunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a majoracquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls forgrowth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year, Shearson\'s takeover offer to the E.F.Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts saidthere had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed whenit approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

Under the plan steel output would remain subject torestrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled foryears to come while steel firms undertook a massiveslimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed theending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EClaw is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\" But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss thisidea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis intheir countries, with orders falling as customers switch toalternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC\'s major steel producing countries arelikely to shy away from Narjes\' proposals and could back theindustry\'s own plan instead, in the hope of minimising thepolitical impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by theEC steelmakers\' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quotaproduction system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for itidentified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis toreduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, thatof hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of theCommission and governments in carrying out a closure program,particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs thisdecade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes. Reuter',1 IRON-STEEL}

Redstone\'s newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with avalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stockstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equityinterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculatedthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making thetotal package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeablepreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share ofconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portionwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone\'s newest plan raised the amount of interest hewould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyondApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. Theplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pctduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offeredeight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the managementgroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,were offering high prices. \"Redstone really wants to own thecompany,\" one said. Another said management seemed to have theedge on the timing issue. Redstone\'s company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom\'s 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine whatthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. Henoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, whichadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititallytraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is nowjust over 30 dlrs. Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell twotwo cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costsfrom several acquisitions affected results. Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at37.50 dlrs. Chris Craft Industries <CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4. Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc <CBS>.The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operatesnine satellite television services and owns television andradio stations.

{0 'Canada\'s decision to raise the issueof a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many seeas a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policystudy group said \"It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period,when it was a major player in the process of building a postwarworld,\" the Washington-based Atlantic Council said. U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summeraimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,the world\'s biggest trading partners with crossborder shipmentsof about 150 billion dlrs annually. The council\'s study said the trade talks, with a deadlineof October for an agreement, are the biggest issue inU.S.-Canadian relations. The study said liberalized trade between the two countrieswould improve the competitiveness of their economies in worldmarkets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties. The council said \"in the past most Canadians have shied awayfrom the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to beoverwhelmed economically and politically by a closerassociation with a country 10 times their size in population.\" But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized theirdomestic market was too small to permit the mass production andsales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by anincreasingly competitive world. The council said that in the talks, Canada is chieflyinterested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposedon Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were beingsubsidized. The council said the chief U.S. concerns included endingcurbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, andthe so-called \"cultural industries\" - publishing, broadcastingand films. It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defensecooperation, \"acid rain\" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadianassertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage. Reuter',1 TRADE}

Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlrtakeover bid for American Medical with several largeshareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass familyof Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated supportone way or the other for his offer, he said. Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on theconversations he held with shareholders, he could not guagewhether he had majority support. He said, however, there issupport for his offer. Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he helddiscussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medicalstock. Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medicalmanagement and other American Medical shareholders. Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, said it believes a restructuring of AmericanMedical and its business would be \"highly desirable andappropriate at this time.\" \"That\'s the sort of position that I find a large segment ofshareholders of AMI really share,\" said Pesch. Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining histakeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, fourdlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for eachAmerican Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join inan effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would notrule out a future takeover try. Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposalwith the Bass family. Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch\'stakeover effort and a further sign that there could be someshareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical\'sprevious rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer fromPesch. American Medical is expected to resist Pesch\'s latest bid.Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said amanagement-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. An American Medical spokesman said the company will commenton the new Pesch offer by March 10. Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor inthe outcome of the bid for control of American Medical. The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in AmericanMedical, and the company has previously said the investorssupport management\'s internal plan to improve the company\'sperformance. The Bass family would not comment on AmericanMedical or Pesch. Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corplast year, continues to face a credibilty problem on WallStreet because of the long time it took to finish the Republicacquisition. Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wallstreet questioning whether financing can be completed for themuch larger American Medical takeover proposal. Pesch\'s first offer for American Medical was made withoutan investment banking firm, another cause for concern to WallStreet. However, Pesch entered his second offer withrepresentation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securitiesand Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group. \"I don\'t have any doubt that the current transaction can beworked out and completed, provided we get to the point whereAmi management will sit down and talk in a friendlyenvironment,\" Pesch said. Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financingarrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds inacquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of AmericanMedical management in place. He said he plans to combine the company with Republic toform an efficient network of hospitals. Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer couldbe made for American Medical. Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved secondfiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worthabout 20 dlrs per share. Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the secondquarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ctloss last year. Nimocks said Pesch\'s revised offer is not worth much morethan the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transactioncould be completed because of the revised structure of theoffer. \"I think it\'s much more doable,\" he said. Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaroundby replacing some members of management and reducing costs. Reuter',1 ACQ}

The report said the French economy was \"increasinglyill-adapted to demand\" selling goods at \"uncompetitive relativeprices on both domestic and export markets.\" \"France\'s poor export performance reflects a geographicalbias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18months,\" it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficitto around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against thefranc could lead to \"a (renewed) loss of competitivenessrelative not only to the United States but also to the newlyindustrialised countries.\" This could result in further major losses of market share,particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost aquarter of French exports, it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved, theauthorities would have \"little scope for macroeconomicmanoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need toencourage a pickup in investment could require demand to growmore briskly,\" it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wagedemands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around atwo pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year, the report took noaccount of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pctsurge in January consumer prices, caused partly by thegovernment\'s deregulation of service sector tariffs. \"We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provokerunaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet hasbeen lost,\" one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oilprices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in thereport, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecastto around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year\'s 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government\'s view that theunderlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year\'sfall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause ofdisinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest inthe OECD area, the inflation differential between France andits main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just onepct this year, it said.

In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mlndlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham LambertInc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of theproceeds to buy TRE stock. Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly sixpct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing. The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SECwas investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TREholdings were working together without disclosing theircooperation, as would be required by the federal securitieslaws. One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whetherSugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of itsintended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mlndlr bond offering. A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unitof Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SECinvestigators and was cooperating with the probe. The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler hadbeen interviewed by the SEC probers. A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked forinformation a few months ago as part of an informal probe. The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agencyand had heard nothing more since that time. \"To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the targetof a formal SEC investigation\" in connection with the TRE bid,he said. A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm hadunderwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added: \"We had nothing to do with TRE.\" As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines tocomment on its enforcement activities.

{0 'The failure of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotascould trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of atleast 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said. Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countriesended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talksover how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discussquotas was set, delegates said. Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under theInternational Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago afterprices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producerselling initially and a price war among commercial coffeeroasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarketshelf this spring, coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer andexporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for thebreakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative anddelegate to the talks, said in a statement after the counciladjourned, \"A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were notprepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objectivecriteria. \"We want to insure that countries receive export quotasbased on their ability to supply the market, instead of theirpolitical influence in the ICO.\" Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Daustercountered, \"Negotiations failed because consumers tried todictate quotas, not negotiate them.\" Previously, quotas were determined by historical amountsexported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global marketof about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wantedquotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producersproposed carving up the export market on the basis ofexportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil\'sshare to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changesin many countries\' export capabilities and make coffee morereadily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largestexporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interimproposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil\'s financial problems,illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments onbank debt, have increased political pressure on the country toprotect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavilyon coffee earnings, particularly some African nations andColombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO\'s failureto agree quotas, analysts said. The expected drop in prices could result in losses of asmuch as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegatesforecast. The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the fullcouncil is not due to meet again until September, delegatessaid. REUTER',1 COFFEE}

{0 'Japan\'s unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year fromJanuary\'s three pct record, senior economists, including SusumuTaketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December\'s 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since thegovernment\'s Management and Coordination Agency began compilingstatistics under its current system in 1953. \"There is a general fear that we will become a country withhigh unemployment,\" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist forthe Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemploymentfigures today, did not make any predictions. \"At present we do not have a forecast for the unemploymentrate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situationimproving,\" a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government hadexpected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conferencethe record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budgetwhich has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen\'s surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steeland shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employeesand ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed agreat number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo BankLtd\'s economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the servicesector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by themanufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as thegovernment stimulates domestic demand under its program totransform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower thanthose of other industrialised nations, methods for calculatingstatistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. \"The three pct figure could translate into a relativelyhigh figure if European methods were used,\" one economist said.More than half of January\'s 170,000 increase in jobless from ayear earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo\'sTsukihara said.

Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow ofcheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales bythird-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap betweenlow prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costsand set for Japanese makers under the agreement. The MITI spokesman said, \"If the percentage of grey marketis increasing for one specific company, it suggests they aredistributing their products through their sales network knowingthey will be exported by some means. In that case we will askthem what they are doing to reduce the figure.\" MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said. But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. \"As longas there is a gap between prices set under the pact and marketprices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap tomake money,\" a Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> spokesman said.

{0 'Thailand\'s improving economy will likelycause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billiondlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion atend-February, private bankers said. Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier. Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the <Bangkok BankLtd>, said Thailand\'s strong export performance, its relativelyhigh interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,contributed to the projected sharp rise. Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected toexpand another 15 pct this year, bankers said. A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand couldachieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, upfrom a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985. Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at itscurrent pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stablethe five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.

The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 netearnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, againstanalysts\' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend untillater this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputationto its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-freeto shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which thefull 49 pct company tax rate has been pid. The company operates on a substituted tax year, not thefiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax atthe 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement. Consequently, it has funds available for distribution withdividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputationlegislation before determining the final payout, it said. Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a pooryear for the minerals industry, with the notable exception ofgold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollarsdeclined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatilityand uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading tosubstantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories havesteadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,but overcapacity continues, CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA saidBougainville Copper Ltd <BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrswhile its share of Comalco Ltd\'s <CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrsagainst 149.2 mln in 1985, it said. Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operationsincurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in1985, CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrsagainst 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mlnfrom 2.8 mln. CRA\'s share of earnings from the Argyle diamond projectamounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.

Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrsbefore capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. Thestrong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rightsissue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debtto be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.

But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 areinaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuadeCongress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper todaypublished China\'s demands in a editorial to coincide with thevisit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. \"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce itsrestrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilitiesfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chineseexports,\" the editorial said. \"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice againstfavourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit Chinainto the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). \"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports inrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict andinfluences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added The paper also printed an article by China\'s commercialcounsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who saidthat \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventingbilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs ontechnology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that, sincebilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit everyyear except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficitsat 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not acceptPeking\'s trade figures at all, mainly because they excludegoods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. WhileU.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it willhave to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend severallaws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs andTrade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and \"not bedominated or controlled by international Communism.\" The official said China was well aware of the laws, someof which date to the anti-Communist early 1950\'s, but thatthere is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To changethem. China has been the subject of about a dozen casesinvolving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,which the U.S. Side won, he said. But, for the first time, China signed last week anagreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrainexports of at least two categories of steel goods, which maylead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide suchvoluntary export restraints would be an important issue inbilateral trade issues and in Peking\'s application to GATT. \"China has the potential to disrupt world markets,especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervousabout China in this respect. But there is a precedent for othercentralled planned economies in GATT,\" the diplomat said. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members ofGATT but none has China\'s massive market potential for importsor its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomedChina\'s interest in participating in GATT. \"The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplishedovernight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a largeeconomy of the Chinese type,\" Shultz said. \"China can play an important role by actively joining GATTdiscussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities andenhance market access for exports worldwide. China can furtherdevelop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximumbenefit from its GATT participation,\" he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membershipare similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmenregard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especiallyfor exports, and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATTlast month, China said it was gradually reforming its economicsystem and replacing mandatory instruction with \"guidanceplanning\" and economic levers.

The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau, Evergo\'s executive director, declined commenton whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake boughtfrom Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo \"was attracted by the underlying strength ofHk Hotels.\" Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possibleredevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia\'s best knownhotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned byHk Hotels. <Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs. Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sunon their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake. \"It is purely coincidence,\" he said. But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergogroup, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may teamup with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover. Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, whichanalysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. MichaelKadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels. Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated tothe Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family hasnot considered any countermoves so far. Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and theKadoorie family to cooperate because of different managementstyles. \"Evergo may want to split up the hotel management andproperty developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may notfit the conservative Kadoorie family,\" said an analyst who askednot to be named. Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had beendistorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value isonly worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and LaiSun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below thecurrent trading price.
