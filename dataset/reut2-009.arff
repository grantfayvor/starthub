He said in a statement a crash program was needed in thesemiconductor industry to prevent the United States frombecoming \"one of the world\'s industrial lightweights.\" Bywater\'s remarks came as the White House Economic PolicyCouncil prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide whatsanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement. The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to endselling semiconductors at below cost and to open its homemarket to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to foregoantidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors. But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stoppeddumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third countrydumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors. Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way toforce prices up and end the dumping. Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense ScienceBoard task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop newelectronic products and manufacturing processes and make theU.S. industory more competitive. But he added the industry could not wait for legislation topass and that action was required now to help the depressedelectronic industry.

Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway overthe currency market than central bank intervention and theseargue for a further dollar decline, dealers said. \"The market can be bigger than the central banks.

As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against theyen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in themarkets on behalf of the U.S. currency. Reports of the authorities\' actions helped the dollarrecover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon fromthe post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it stillfailed to regain Monday\'s U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen. Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollarsyesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that theFed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yentoday. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchaseda small amount of dollars for yen. The Fed\'s last confirmed intervention was on January 28when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank ofJapan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to havesignalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks. The authorities\' actions appeared to back up the February22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperateto foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels. But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed bythe authorities\' intervention which they said can only softenextreme moves in the market. For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed\'spurchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather thanfor the U.S. central bank\'s own account, suggesting a rather watered-down American commitment to the currency accord. The Bank of England\'s action also was thought to becompleted on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcingthe market\'s view that Japan is the most resolute of the sixnations in its support of the currency pact. \"No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the othertwo central banks seem to be making more token gestures thananything else,\" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp. \"I\'m not convinced the intervention was concerted,\" saidEarl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. \"It\'s a yen problem more than anything else.\" Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionistsentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the Americanauthorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen. \"The dollar\'s break below the key 150 yen level ties theTreasury\'s hands behind its back.

Such comments reflect the view that the currency marketsare becoming increasingly politicized.

The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise tradedeficit in 1986 was with Japan.

It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant toextend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said. Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury SecretaryJames Baker \"about the inappropriateness of using publicresources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which weboth see as an inherent aspect of the proposed internationaldebt facility.\" He also said a proposal for establishing formal proceduresfor international negotiations on currency exchange rates \"isunrealistic and could well have damaging effects.\" \"For example, the bill\'s directive to intitiate negotiationsin order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar-- a matter upon which there can be considerable differenceamong analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentiallydestabilizing market expectations,\" Volcker said. He recommended \"we should not lock ourselves into formalizedprocedures for international negotiations\" on exchange rates butinstead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmetingin Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representativesand those of major trade allies.

{0 'U.S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassedacreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as oneof the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixtyyears, Agriculture Department officials said. USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.Agriculture Department analysts said next week\'s figures willlikely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,down 22 pct from last year\'s plantings of 83.3 mln acres. Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. cornproduction will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987corn production could drop by over one billion bushels toaround seven billion bushels. Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grainsprogram, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservationprogram, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrainanalysts said. \"There\'s no question that there will be a sharp decrease incorn acreage,\" one said. \"It\'s difficult for any farmer to notgo along with the program this year.\" Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year butat a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said. Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, theysaid, compared to last year\'s level of 61.5 mln acres. If analysts\' unofficial estimates prove correct then thedrop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 whenfarmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program. Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. Asevere drought that summer in major producing states causedyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2billion bushels. Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analystssaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billionbushels, down from last year\'s crop of 8.3 billion bushels. \"This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significantreduction in production,\" an analyst said.

High producing corn belt states are expected to show thegreatest acreage reductions, based upon historicalparticipation in government programs, analysts said.

{0 'The United States may soon ease its1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringingforward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for thefourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressmanrepresenting sugar growers told Reuters in an interview. Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the Housesubcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated theeasing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern aboutthe impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year. \"With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to onemln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbeancountries and the Philippines,\" Huckaby said. By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, thequota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons. Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the thirdquarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the Septemberto December period \"we could get away without having toincrease the quota.\" He noted that some in the sugar industry believe anincrease in the quota is justified. Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugarrefiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials torequest a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refinerssaid the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictivethere could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S laterthis year, a refiner spokesman said. However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that itwould consider the request. Following the refiners\' request, representatives of theFlorida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express oppositionto any quota expansion, industry sources said. The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from asugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect ofthe current sugar program, indicates at least some growerofficials are concerned enough to support an easing of theimport quota, industry officials said. Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by theReagan administration\'s interagency sugar policy group.

{0 'External Affairs Minister Joe Clarktoday vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. actionagainst Canadian potash exports, but also warned againstraising the alarm too early in the dispute. In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations,the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimouslyMonday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 millionU.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry. \"We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure thatCanadian interests are well protected,\" Clark told the House ofCommons in the daily question period. But he said the opposition parties should be careful \"notto raise false alarms too early.\" The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department\'strade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potashproducers from New Mexico, claiming unfair governmentsubsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada\'s shipments. Canada, the world\'s largest potash producer, exported 9.8mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a thirdgoing to the U.S. Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan. In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded theruling as just another \"trade harrassment\" from the U.S. andcriticized Clark\'s assurances the country\'s interests would beprotected. \"We received exactly the same kind of assurances in thesoftwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,\"Axworthy said. Canada\'s Progressive Conservative government agreed toimpose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlierthis year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute withthe U.S. Axworthy urged the government to present Canada\'s case toworld trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another exampleof why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateralirritants in the free trade negotiations under way with theU.S. \"What we are seeking to do is put in place a bettersystem,\" Clark said.

{0 'Automobile dealerships have becomelarge, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year. Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers andbuyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that thelargest are considering offering shares to the public, analystssay. Retail car sales \"are at a point of transition. There\'s notmuch that\'s off the table in terms of creative thinking\" aboutways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the Universityof Michigan\'s Transportation Research Institute. The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than itwas in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroitanalyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates. Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.Dealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or aStudebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the NationalAutomobile Dealers Association. That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany\'s VolkswagenBeatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"arebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom fromrestrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,says Jauppi. One of the most visible changes in retail car sales hasbeen in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-foldincrease from 1956--and employed 34 workers. \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mlndlrs a year and didn\'t know what to do with all his money,\"says Cole. \"There\'s a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than thatmake cars,\" he says. With the increase in size, large dealers have been buyingup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trendwill let up. Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800principal owners today. Many dealers are experimenting with owning severalfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"Itused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now aChevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says. As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking aboutthe possibility that some of them might become publicly-ownedor open international operations. Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,\"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole. Although some say the franchise system might get in the wayof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles totrading in car dealer shares. \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thingthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells thosecars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says. \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at thescale some of these dealers, it\'s going to be very hard toresist taking them public,\" said another analyst. And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to becomeinternational. \"We\'re going to have international dealers--dealer networksthat are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attractedparticularly to Europe, where the market will expand fasterthan the U.S., he says. \"It\'s not totally off the wall,\" says Cole. Reuter',1 ACQ}

They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings ofbetween 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mlnin 1985. The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to paya total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents ashare in 1985. James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson\'s1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the incometo retail sales. Analysts said the group\'s 7-Eleven retail stores and itsfranchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxurygoods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow. Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put JardineMatheson\'s 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said heestimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985. But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson\'s earnings from its 35pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG> will fall toabout 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985. The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from HongKong Land of <Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September. Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm asa result of the spin-off.

{0 'China\'s first joint venture bank, XiamenInternational Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank\'s first full year ofoperation. General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profitforecast, saying targets were under study. Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group\'soutstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowingsrose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters. Liu said most of the group\'s profit came from the parentcompany rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries <XiamenInternational Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and <LusoInternational Bank Ltd> in Macao. The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985but did not officially open until March 1986. Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreignpartner, Hong Kong-listed <Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cutlast year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreignbanks felt the XIB\'s reputation would be improved if the threeChinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said. Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin wereunfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported aloss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of268,000 dlrs in 1985. The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank ofChina, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) andXiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10). One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced thesame problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete onunequal terms with state-owned banks. The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almostsaturated, he added. Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefittedfrom contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But theforeign banker, who asked not to be named, said it facedinternal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank. Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the InternationalAgricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and thestate-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eightforeign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of HongKong or overseas Chinese banks.

{0 'Governments of major Asianproducing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a newInternational Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers andtraders are unhappy with the development, according to viewspolled by Reuter correspondents. Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, whichproduce the bulk of the world\'s rubber, said they expected thenew pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubberindustries remain viable in the long-term. But traders and growers said they were against the new pactbecause its buffer stock mechanism was likely to intereferewith free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises. The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires onOctober 22, was formally adopted by most of the world\'sproducers and consumers in Geneva last Friday. It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters inNew York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enterinto force provisionally when ratified by countries accountingfor 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik saidthe formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears ofliquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubberand a possible depression of prices. He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue tokeep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices roseor fell through its buffer stock system. Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing ofpurchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and acontingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be donethrough direct cash contributions from members, he said. Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks tofinance INRA\'s buffer stock purchases. This has been viewedwith concern by some members who fear the INRA may becomeindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the InternationalTin Agreement. \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried outwithout any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said. Malaysia, the world\'s largest producer, was seekingcabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producersand consumers would also become members, he said. Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefitto Indonesia\'s rubber industry\'s by stabilising prices. It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement becauseits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said. Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the newpact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debtthe INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his marketoperations. Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a freerubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices atlevels that were only acceptable to consumers. \"With the INRA\'s ability to keep prices at a certain stablelevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,while producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a MalaysianRubber Producers Council source told Reuters. Producers also wanted a free rubber market without theoverhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which hadpsychologically prevented price rises, he said. State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices hadbeen depressed since INRA\'s inception and the creation of abuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise. Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it wasexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added. Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might bepressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential tostabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producersto produce more. Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact\'sconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely toallow sharp price fluctuations in future. \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must beliquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said. Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for successas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but theyquestioned the ability of some financially-strapped producersto finance buffer stock operations.

Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential JapanFederation of Employers\' Associations, (Nikkeiren), toldreporters: \"The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economyis not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan).\" \"The yen\'s level depends on the condition of the U.S.Economy rather than Japan\'s economy, and as long as theAmerican situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise,\" hesaid. To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said. He rejected recent calls from some government quarters forwage increases this year as a means of raising privateconsumption and thus boosting domestic demand. \"We have to keep wages as low as possible,\" he said. He also said the yen\'s large and rapid rise is depressingthe outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in additionto hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic marketmanufacturers through cheap imports. Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsukisaid. Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and adownturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect serviceindustries, he said. It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fullyemploy those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, hesaid. Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall inthe business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possiblerecession in the Japanese economy, he said. Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyondlevels experienced in 1986. The government\'s Economic Planning Agency said last weekthe economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performancesince 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oilprice crisis. In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost theeconomy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of landand reforming the nation\'s housing stock are needed, along withsteps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated tobring about currency stability in line with the Parisagreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperateto that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene ifnecessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall waslikely. But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currencylevels would be considered in line with underlying economicfundamentals. In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to holdcurrencies around their then current levels. Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behindthe fall of the dollar to a record low against the yenyesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as itnervously reacted to statements abroad and to developmentssurrounding trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekendthat the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for thedollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter calledU.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained. The market reacted nervously because the dollar has beenmoving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate toremain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharprise of the yen.

The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNGon the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he toldthe Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annualconference. Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-WestCenter in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacificpetroleum outlook. With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharakisaid. The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the bestoil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG. The PNG government\'s Geological Survey in a paperdistributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves atabout 500 mln barrels. PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region withno secondary taxes, Fesharaki said. \"We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, anddiscovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to(light) Bass Strait crude,\" Fesharaki said. There are also large pockets of high quality condensates tobe produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which iscapable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said. But prices should be somewhat higher than the presentlevels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.

{0 'South Africa\'s new foreign debtagreement sparked a rally in local financial markets, butbankers and economists said the pact removes only one source ofanxiety from a still depressed economy. \"We have not gone from \'no confidence\' to \'full confidence\'yet,\" commented one banker, who saw the agreement as havingmarginal influence on fundamental economic problems. Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as themain impetus behind increases today in both the commercial andfinancial rand. The commercial rand, used for current account transactions,rose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumpednearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts. All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners takeplace through the financial rand, which is considered the mainbarometer of South Africa\'s attractiveness to overseasinvestors. Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gainsin the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S.Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks. They said the financial rand in particular was being drivenby a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that couldfavorably affect the currency. Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loanbalances and short-term claims into equity investments in SouthAfrica. Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bankwas \"investigating the implications of such conversions in lightof terms and restrictions of the financial rand system.\" Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night saidthe recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that\"some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic viewof South Africa.\" Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over thenext three years. The agreement extends a standstillarrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place sinceAugust, 1985. Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmedtheir private estimates and could be comfortably met by themonetary authorities. \"They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and weoffered the minimum,\" said one banking source, reacting toreports from London that creditors were hoping for largerrepayments. Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africashould have \"no difficulty whatsoever\" with the terms. Economists said the debt agreement would have nosignificant impact on economic problems continuing to faceSouth Africa including high rates of inflation andunemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty. Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speakingyesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was \"inbad shape\" and there was \"an awful lot of talk but little action\"to cure serious problems.

Stock market analysts said today\'s generally weak stockmarket plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BATshares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in theshare price. \"In the current market, people almost expect companies tobeat expectations,\" said one analyst, adding that pretax profitsof 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast. BAT\'s 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985pretax profit of 1.17 billion. Brokers noted that BAT\'s shift away from itsunderperforming industries and the decreasing share of thetobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs. BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that thetobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74pct four years ago.

{0 'Energy Secretary John Herrington hasproposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he saidall would cost the Treasury money and will come under closeWhite House scrutiny before action is taken. One measure he said he favored would raise the depletionallowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well asproduction using enhanced extraction methods. Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending thetax code, but would look at the proposal. Herrington\'s proposals to spur production were made alongwith the release last week of the energy department\'s report onenergy and the national security. The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damagingimplications for national security. He has said since in speeches and at news conferences thatany plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil productionwould have to meet three criteria--increase production, notcause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer. Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,spurring production but fail the second and third. He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oilprices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwideand cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs. A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteriaby not increasing domestic production. In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remainsfirmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax. Options which meet Herrington\'s criteria include: - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults byborrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that ifoil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults thatcould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs. - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. Itwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year. - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysicalexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels aday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs. - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage tospur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre forthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lowerthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs. Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administrationproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cutthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily. He also called again for Congressional approval to exploreoff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billionbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, whichmay hold nine billion barrels. Herrington said he understood the Reagan\'s reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of theseproposals, but added he hoped his department\'s energy/securitystudy would make a strong case for the need to help thestruggling domestic oil industry. Another move Herrington said he will press anew, eventhough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is toraise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000. This, he said, would further bolster national security incase of an oil-supply disruption. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May oneto shareholders of record April 15. The company said it omitted the common dividend to coverboth losses from a commercial ship conversion contract andincreased reserves for previously announced discontinuedshipyard operations. In addition, the company said its lenders agreed totemporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolvingcredit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln. The reduction will hold through May 15, it said. Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirementallowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and preventedit from violating covenants of its credit agreement. The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders toextend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15. Todd added that it has suffered financially because of theU.S. Navy\'s unwillingness to release certain retentions undercompleted ship construction contracts and a general decrease inU.S. military spending.

{0 'Canada\'s federal governmentwill provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package thatincludes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of acompany\'s oil and gas exploration and development costs, EnergyMinister Marcel Masse announced. The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year intothe oil and gas industry and could lead to more than onebillion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference. The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada onor after April 1, 1987. Masse told reporters that the government\'s oil industry aidpackage is aimed at small and medium sized companies. The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration andDevelopment Incentive Program, will restrict the total paymentsthat any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year. Masse said the program will probably generate newemployment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year. He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration anddevelopment spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oilprices fell during the first half of 1986. Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decidedto provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax payingcompanies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the fullvalue of the incentive. Such companies would not immediatelybenefit from tax benefits, he said. The federal government also wanted to deliver an aidprogram outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilsonis now reviewing Canada\'s tax system and plans to announce taxreform proposals later this spring. An important feature of the aid program is a decision tolet companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors tobenefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits toonly participating companies, he said. Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make iteasier for companies to attract investors in exploration anddevelopment, Masse said. He told reporters his department is still consideringwhether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify forthe subsidy. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

The buffer stock working group of consumers and producerswas set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly forthe first time, they said.

Huckaby, chairmanof the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugarissues, told Reuters in an interview. Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this yearthey must halt production increases, said he will deliver thesame message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He alsosaid he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject. Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domesticsweetener output increases is an effort to forestall furthercuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons. \"I think if we\'re talking about dropping (the quota)another half mln tons, lets say, you\'re getting to the pointwhere the program might not work,\" he said. \"Ideally, I\'d like to freeze things right where we are,\"said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress. A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about thecurrent level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of theU.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar importsholding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said. A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be madeuntil 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said. \"I feel like if we didn\'t expand production, we couldprobably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least throughthe 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),\"Huckaby said. However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrupproducers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetenermarket from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said. He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners willcapture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market inthe U.S. But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in theproduction of a new crystalline corn sweetener which furtherexpanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar importsmight be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced. Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refinercompanies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon. \"This program is advantageous to the corn users. They havesome natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that theprogram is preserved,\" Huckaby said. Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives tothink about how domestic output could be controlled, eitherthrough production allocations, acreage or marketing controls. Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from theJustice Department to determine if it would be legal to askcorn refiners to limit production. \"I don\'t know if we will go this route, but if we dothere\'s a question in my mind at this point in time; can you dothat legally?\" he said. Asked if he would proceed with production controls withoutthe support of corn refiners, Huckaby said \"You build a fragilehouse if you do it that way.\" Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmershave expanded production, because high sugar price supportmeans returns from sugar are higher than competing crops suchas soybeans and grain.

The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral tradingagreement with the United States while protecting Canadianpolitical sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketingsystems, the auto industry and Canada\'s cultural identity. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said theresolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed freetrade agreement between the two countries, which are eachother\'s largest trading partners. \"We need a truly free trade agreement, which means bothcountries have to work toward a deal that is mutuallybeneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement,\" the TexasDemocrat said in a statement. \"I do not question Canada\'s right to protect its politicalsovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrasesmean the government of Canada means to take important economicissues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeplyconcerned,\" he added. Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways whilethe United States uses only six trade restriction methods. Hesaid if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries getrid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fairand might not win Senate approval. \"I am deeply concerned that when the President visits PrimeMinister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented withthis kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I didwhen I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficialagreement will be successful,\" Bentsen said.

The company recorded these liabilities based on older,higher tax rates, but an action being considered by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain ofabout 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained. \"Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned,\"Columbia Gas said. Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit therecovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia GasTransmission Corp, the company\'s principal pipeline subsidiary.

The officials, asking not to be identified, said thegovernment will investigate an industry contention that steel imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is beingdiverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns aboutthe level of Canadian exports south of the border. But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified,said that despite intense pressure from the ReaganAdministration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formallimits on Canadian shipments to the U.S. \"In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,\"said one official who claimed Canadian companies were \"fairtraders\" in the big American market. If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a monitoring system will be established in the next three or fourmonths. \"I guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we wouldhave to do something about it,\" said a trade official. Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pctof the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the leveljust two years ago. The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time ofgrowing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports fromseveral countries in the face of a decline among domestic steelproducers. Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada\'s share of theAmerican market be limited to 2.4 per cent. The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreigncompanies to obtain permits to import steel into the country.Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or rawsteel, which makes up less than half the steel market.

{0 'Kansas City Southern Industries Incsaid it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern PacificTransportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp <SFX> ifthe Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe\'s attemptto reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa andSanta Fe Railway. In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlinedfour conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific. Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into anagreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilitesof Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and thatthe financial condition of Southern remain largely unchangedfrom today onward. \"We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market valueoffer in cash for the Southern Pacific,\" said Kansas CitySouthern president and chief executive officer Landon H.Rowland. \"This offer disproves the constant derogation of theSourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSPChief Executive John Schmidt\'s comment in ICC hearings that theSouthern Pacific was \'bankrupt,\'\" said Rowland. He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achievethe benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving theindependece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing primecompetitor, Santa Fe. Kansas said that Southern\'s management had estimated thevalue of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to1.2 billion dlrs. It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon BrothersInc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in theirmerger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and800 mln dlrs less than Southern\'s own internal valuations. Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer forSouthern after its books, records and properties are examined. \"Once that examination has been completed (and even in theabsence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make anoffer in writing....\" said the company. Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fehad not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission\'sreconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and SouthernPacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel eachother throughout their routes. ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger asinherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioningfor reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreementswith the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western andother railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per sharetender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorpgained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE. Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event hisgroup wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling andentertainment units are potential divestiture candidates.

The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week thatpayment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who askednot to be identified said. USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, sayingit did not take into account storage, handling and transportsavings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided tore-examine the costs, sources said. The issue is an important one, because congressional budgetcommittees are known to be considering limiting the use ofcertificates as a means of cutting spending. Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before theSenate Agriculture Committee tomorrow. Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there areuncertainties in determining the cost of certificates comparedto cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said. USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 centsto store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put ingovernment storage. It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress\' investigativearm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs thegovernment more to use certificates instead of cash in farmprice and income support programs, Reagan administrationsources said. The GAO is expected to point out that use ofpayment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tightstorage by moving grain that otherwise might not have beensold. The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate DirectorBrian Crowley comes as congressional budget committeesintensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federalbudget deficit -- including considering limits on the use ofPIK certificates. The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, orcerts, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays tofarmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used torepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities orcash. Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billiondlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January andAugust 1987, according to USDA. Certs can cost the government more than cash primarilybecause recipients can use the certificates to pay backgovernment loans at levels below the loan rate. Eliminating this practice, called \"PIK and roll,\" would savethe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according tothe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, accordingto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificatescost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments. The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to beconsidering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among othersavings alternatives. The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that theestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to datehave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mlndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, oneadministration official said.

The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributableto the different effect certificates can have on market pricesover the course of a crop year. USDA\'s Economic Research Service, for example, has foundthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels ofcorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn bybetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel.

{0 'BP says it will tender for remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil at 70 dlrs a share cash',1 ACQ}
{0 'British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> said itintended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard OilCo <SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, fora total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted. The offer would be made through its <BP North America Inc>unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. Theoffer would not be conditional on any minimum number of sharesbeing tendered. BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was basedon its own valuation as well as those of its financialadvisers. It took into account reviews of both public andnon-public information. Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down1-3/4 dlrs. BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p atlast night\'s close. About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP\'sown resources. The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly frombanks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility andpartly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. Thecompany said it was in the course of arranging thesefacilities. BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group\'sinvestment in Standard was its largest single asset. Fullownership would enable investment and operating decisions to bemade without the limitations of a minority interest. BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimumuse of its financial resources. It was confident oil priceswere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify theinvestment. Walters added that it also felt that, due to managementchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully evenin a lower oil price environment. Standard\'s net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrsand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs beforetax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs. Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.One noted that it was not immediately clear why the groupshould spend so much money buying a company it alreadycontrolled. BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standardshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago. It was also unclear what effect the tender would have onthe U.K. Government\'s recent announcement that it intended todispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the1987/88 financial year, analysts said. Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson notedthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP woulddepend on the reaction of the markets. The deal would probably push BP\'s gearing up to around 59pct from 20 pct currently, he said. However, with the likelihood that oil prices would notrepeat last year\'s rapid drop the prospects for Standardreturning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting fromits cash flow -- were good. Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted. Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel tomake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue fromproduction and its downstream activities would push itcomfortably into surplus. BP initially took a stake in Standard following thediscovery of oil in Alaska\'s Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP hadinadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crudeoil. The analysts said that BP had promoted a major managementreorganisation of Standard in the past year. The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard wasnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of thetender offer, Spedding said. BP\'s willingness to take hard decisions such as majorbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been wellreceived in the markets. The lower costs that should now be possible -- especiallyafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to comestraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back byother sectors.

{0 'Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> said in astatement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite afall in turnover due to lower foreign sales. The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar andother currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressureon selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices ofcrude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale ofpolystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands. World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01billion from 42.72 billion. Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billionmarks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct. The statement made no mention of net profit figures.Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23. In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by thecold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continuesat present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below theprevious year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from1986, Hoechst said. Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and informationtechnology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell. Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance ofthe parent company, other units in West Germany, and to<American Hoechst Corp>. Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected therestructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities. Roussel Uclaf <RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidatedpartners did not perform as well as in 1985. Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretaxprofits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earningsfrom interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall inextraordinary costs. The fall in raw material prices was not enough tocompensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices andcurrencies, Hoechst said. The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in newprojects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capitalincrease of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with theacquisition of <Celanese Corp>.

This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in thefirst three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 311986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs. The analysts estimated that the group would report a thirdquarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter. BHP\'s earnings in the first half ended November 30 amountedto 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier. The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn inpetroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflectingsome improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Straitfields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral andsteel earnings. They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coalprices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has beenaffected by industrial and production problems. The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP\'slowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around300 mln dlrs. One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be atax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance oncapital expenditure in the steel division, they said. They said they saw BHP\'s full year earnings at around 900mln to 920 mln dlrs.

{0 'Japan\'s plan to cut beef interventionprices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boostdemand because of strict supply controls and a complexdistribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said. \"Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meetingconsumers\' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,\" aHousewives Association of Japan official said. Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farmmarkets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, whichmaintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers. Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, thestandard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbledbeef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820. The standard price of other beef, mainly produced fromdairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceilingat 1,325 against 1,420. Ministry officials said the semi-government LivestockIndustry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operationsto help keep wholesale beef prices within the interventionprice zone. The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amountset by the government under a quota system. When wholesaleprices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef whenprices are below. But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beefstocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.

{0 'Japan\'s plan to cut beef interventionprices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boostdemand because of strict supply controls and a complexdistribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said. \"Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meetingconsumers\' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,\" aHousewives Association of Japan official said. Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farmmarkets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, whichmaintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers. Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, thestandard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbledbeef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820. The standard price of other beef, mainly produced fromdairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceilingat 1,325 against 1,420. Ministry officials said the semi-government LivestockIndustry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operationsto help keep wholesale beef prices within the interventionprice zone. The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amountset by the government under a quota system. When wholesaleprices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef whenprices are below. But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beefstocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.

{0 'World group turnover of Siemens AG<SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the currentyear to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first fivemonths, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said. Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02billion marks. Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly dueto payment in January for a West German nuclear power stationwhich led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct. In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed athree pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures. In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8billion marks against the same 1985/86 period. For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise betweenone and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion. Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, thecommunications and telecommunications sectors in particularshould contribute to growth this year, Kaske said. But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of thedollar, Kaske said. Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 groupnet profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in thesame period in the previous year. Turnover in the first five months rose particularlystrongly in the installations and automotive technology,communications and telecommunications sectors, but componentsand energy and automation showed a sharp decline. Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks inthe first five months of this year, or nine pct above theirlevel in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular byorders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary. Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. Anincrease in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroadwas balanced by the decline in the dollar. While the installations and automotive technology sectorshowed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation andcommunications orders were below the level achieved in the sameperiod of 1985/86. Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the samelevel. Kaske said investments were expected to remain around sixbillion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previousyear. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover. REUTER',1 EARN}

Krupp GmbH<KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year. Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement. Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar\'sweakness against the mark and oil and raw materials pricefalls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year. The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery andplant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales. Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineeringbusiness achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions hadunderpinned machinery and component activities. An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, thetrading and services sectors, affected the group\'s total orderfigures. However, \"all business sectors contributed to the positiveresults achieved in 1986,\" Krupp added, without giving details. Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marksfrom the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct oforders against 40 pct in 1985. Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11member companies which comprise the core area of the group,rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said. The group\'s orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks atend-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year. Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased bythree pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said. The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration inforeign trade and a downturn in a number of customerindustries.

{0 'Firms need not be pessimistic about exportprospects even though foreign markets have become moredifficult because of the mark\'s strength the Economics Ministrysaid. The ministry\'s parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georgvon Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports couldstart rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing thelower export trend which emerged in mid-1986. But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be noneed to worry about the economy as long as the weakness ofexports did not affect currently good domestic demand. Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good butnoted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. \"Thisis certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not forstimulative steps,\" he said. The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to workactively to promote free world trade, he added. Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good exportopportunities. Price alone was not the only factor ininternational competitiveness, he said, adding German firmshave a reputation for high quality standards, prompt deliverytimes and good service. Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficultposition on its trade figures. It faced international pressureto reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worriedabout the effect of the mark\'s strength on the country\'sexporters. Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to arecord 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise wasdue entirely to the lower value of imports caused by thedecline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports havein fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

{0 'The monetary authorities of the majorindustrialised countries lost their credibility this week asthe dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers andwidespread central bank intervention, dealers said. The dollar\'s fall below 150 yen, which follows last month\'sParis currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, WestGermany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal ofthe success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plazameeting to weaken the dollar, they said. The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar wasovervalued but this time the market and the authorities are ondifferent sides, dealers said. Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations hasencouraged the market to challenge the authorities despiteconcerted intervention by the central banks of the UnitedStates, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said. Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa foraction to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend bycomments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there wasno target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway. Yesterday\'s comment by Baker that he stood by the Parisaccord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said. The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman PaulVolcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to ahalt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, theynoted. The situation has again raised the question of whetherintervention can succeed against the trend in today\'s hugecurrency markets. Dealers said the market\'s cool response tointervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars. \"This means that the current dollar selling is not of asheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,\" said KoichiMiyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank. Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite theintervention and it is only a matter of time before someoperators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed inTokyo today at 149.40 against New York\'s 149.30/40. Its recordlow was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday. Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support torise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Sevenindustrial nations meets to discuss currencies again. The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plusItaly) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currenciesapart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said. Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could beused and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Parisaccord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing toprevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.Trade deficit, especially with Japan. Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for alower dollar is also limiting Washington\'s options, they said. The market now thinks the central bank action is to slowthe dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, saidTadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected largeforward dollar sales from April to June for export billsfalling due for Japanese exporters from April to September. The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yendepreciation, dealers said. Yesterday\'s request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looksineffective in light of this real demand, they said. The market is also anticipating active institutional dollarsales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the newbusiness year starting April 1, dealers said. \"The market seems to have established a new dollar tradingrange between 147 and 149 yen,\" one dealer said. The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Parisaccord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the lowend for the dollar against the yen, he said. Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to145. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'Efforts by governments to control wheatsurpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partialsuccess, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in itslatest monthly report. Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducingboth price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWCsays in a survey of support prices in the five main wheatexporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S. In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for exportincome, there may be problems in reducing production. A policy of cutting wheat production could lead tounemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could thenlead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems. The IWC outlines three courses of action open togovernments in wheat exporting countries. They could continue to support prices in the hope that whenthe world economy improves demand for wheat will rise andsurpluses wil be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat whichcould be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a longperiod. This option may prove to be the most politicallyunattractive and would result in many producers abandoningwheat production, the report said. The third option would be for governments to distinguishbetween the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,possibly varying support prices according to farm size oroverall production. The IWC review covers support prices in the major exportingcountries since 1982. At some time during that period all theproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses. These changes did not always result in lower exportsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations morethan offset lower prices in the domestic currency. For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC interventionprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 Europeancurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in whichmost export transactions are denominated, the interventionprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost ofsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequersand some governments are now searching for ways to cutexpenditure, the report says. The proportion of world wheat output produced by the fivemajor exporters declined in the period covered by the surveyfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due toincreased production in China and India. The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this wascountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by loweracreages. In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 percent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch toother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNPwhich is traditionally where it has been, but the FederalGovernment is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker saidspending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits. Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed byHouse Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes. \"The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunateapproach to take,\" the Treasury Secretary said.

On the international front, Baker said banks must do morelending to developing countries. He was questioned about thisafter the Standard and Poor\'s Corp downgrading today of thedebt of six major money center bank holding companies, largelybecause of their heavy developing nation loan exposure. Baker said that developing countries must adopt free marketeconomic policies such as in the United States.

The money must come either through equity or debt and Bakersaid that developing nations\' \"investment regimes do notsupport enough equity investment, so you\'ve got to have somedebt there.\" Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said \"I thinkyou\'re going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction thisyear.\" Reuter',1 TRADE}

The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comesafter the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billionpesetas. A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higherovernight call money rates were expected in the short term inview of disappointing money supply figures for February. The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in publichands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January andcompared with this year\'s eight pct target. Money supply growthwas 11.4 pct last year. The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by aquarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of theyear and have been increased to drain liquidity on risingdemand for funds. \"The policy is proving counter-productive andrates will have to come down in the long-term,\" the bankspokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries.

Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weakermorning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted indexagainst a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged fromyesterday\'s close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level. The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil tradepattern would undermine international support for sterling,which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begunto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending ratesto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards. But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.

Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs. Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, manyinvestors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said. Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stockexchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver. Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG\'sforeign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold ispoised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second halfof this year. The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs anounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said. Reuter',1 GOLD}

World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it worldmarket leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said. Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all goldEagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were inEurope and about eight pct in Asia. She said despite introduction of several new gold bullioncoins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preservethe Eagle\'s strong market share with extensive publicity. The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,as long as this is available at market prices. The remaininggold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from theopen market, Pope said. Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition herefrom the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent fromthe South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf\'sWest German market share at 60 pct. The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buygold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pctvalue-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ouncecoins traded today at 906 marks, they said. Competition may also come from new gold coins, includingBelgium\'s ECU, which began sales today.

{0 'Aluminium scrap recovery and usage andoutput of secondary metal will continue to rise, said ShearsonLehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium marketwhich details cost and demand factors. Although primary smelting costs have declined generally inrecent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offeredby secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted materialincreasingly attractive. It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricityto produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said. On the demand side, developments in automobiles andpackaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption. Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for theforeseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castingsis gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,particularly in the U.S. In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium todominate the beverage can market in any of the other majoreconomies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there isevidence recycling is on the increase in other countries. In addition to the cost savings involved, technologyadvances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced bythe secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.

Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions againstalleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and,since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases withthe Business Appeal Court in The Hague. The basic complaint is that the levy does not take accountof currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compoundersin countries with strong currencies may have to pay more intheir own currency than is paid to them by producers in anothercountry. Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement thatcompanies can pay the amount they receive toward the levyrather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch graincommodity board. The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial andlegal backing to the test case in the Business AdministrationCourt in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10. The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the companyfor the test case from among the 80 lodged \"because the bill(the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of thelevy contained significant currency distortions and involvedgrain from a wide variety of origins.\" The name of the companyis not being made public. The Administration Court is not expected to make a finalruling on the case in the near future.

He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Fivenations and Canada agreed in Paris to \"see if there can\'t be aperiod of reasonable stability instead of volatility\" to givetime for the committments in Paris to take place. Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. interventionwas not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied thatthe administration judged that after economic adjustments,current exchange rates reflect underlying economicfundamentals. In particular, the stability sought by the nations wouldallow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economiesdomestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulfordsaid in his testimony. He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar wouldhurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth. Mulford noted that half of West Germany\'s economy wasaffected by international developments. He also said increased Japanese domestic growth wouldresult in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarilylead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Grammasserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market. Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, \"I thinkexchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany\'s andJapan\'s) efforts can be carried out. Mulford rejected Gramm\'s argument that faster domesticgrowth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lowerdollar.

Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with majorproducers and consumers this morning to resolve outstandingdifferences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoathe buffer stock can purchase and price differentials fordifferent varieties. Delegates were fairly confident the differences could beworked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow. Some consuming member nations, including Britain andBelgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pctnon-member cocoa, delegates have said. The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower qualitynon-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will mosteffectively support prices because that low quality cocoa iscurrently pressuring the market. Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make upat most a very small percentage of the buffer. They sayMalaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless itis a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoaMalaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said. As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higherdifferential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recentproposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoabought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said. Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a waythat would not promote buffer stock purchases of the moreexpensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said. Other technical points need to be sorted out, includinglimits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy innearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequenteffect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.

{0 'The Bundesbank\'s options for WestGermany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable futureby the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions andemployers, economists and money market dealers said. Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pcttreasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached. But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikelyto encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely forfear of upsetting the current wage round. One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, \"Idon\'t think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whateverhappens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all itwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\" In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the groundfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessmentsof growth and inflation, economists said. Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if theBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in themedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands. As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no movethat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said. In the current round, the country\'s most powerful union,the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, isdemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from thepresent 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages. The engineering employers\' association, Gesamtmetall, isoffering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and givea two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 thisyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988. The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe\'s largestunion, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set thebenchmark for settlements in other industries such as thepublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiationsbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude byearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June. Though many economists said the unions\' current warningstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy andwould not lead to a repeat of 1984\'s damaging seven-weekstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly ontheir positions and there could still be conflict. This could extend the length of time in which theBundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said. The money market head said the unions\' humiliation by theprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperativehousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy. \"The unions haven\'t forgotten that and they will put thissquarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said. In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metallunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined thanhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battleto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership. More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly insouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hoursyesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH andaerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH. Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out inwarning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said. Money market dealers said that overnight call money rateswould rise in the near future in any case and did not depend ona politically-inhibited Bundesbank. About eight billion marks were coming into the markettomorrow from salary payments by the federal government. As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank\'s offerto mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,anticipating still lower rates before the month-end. But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customerswas due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short ofliquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling. Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'Less than two months after FirstInterstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmericaCorp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought. In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he\'s looking forways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,\"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain ourindependence, if possible.\" In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the majorEast Coast banks to buy banks in California. First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, andthe nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 westernstates and has franchise operations in four additional states. Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target forlarge U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region. While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, whenasked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,\"That\'s undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naivenot to think that.\" Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as\"opportunistic\". He said he will look for banks in management trouble thathe can get at a bargain, then add management to restoreprofitability, or for banks in states where First Interstatealready operates, then cut costs by combining resources. The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said mostof the banks are already well managed, but might be purchasedat a discount because of the depressed regional economy. Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might movehim to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, \"Wecontinue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot ofpeople continue to monitor and look at us.\" Banking analysts, however, consider another FirstInterstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happenany time soon. Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25billion dlr bid at the nation\'s second largest bank, \"a very,very difficult decision.\" With that decision made, however, he acknowledged FirstInterstate may now have a difficult time keeping its numberfour position in the California banking community. \"The competition in this state is tough,\" he said, notingCityBank\'s recent purchase of 50 financial service branchesfrom Sears Roebuck company. \"CityBank is moving rapidly to moveus down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,\" he said. Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that SecurityPacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regionalcompetitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated. \"Security is, has been and continues to be a highlyprofitable and obviously well managed company,\" he said. He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has theadvantages of having owned and managed regional banks longerand has the recognition advantage of having given its regionalbanks a common name. Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in goodfinancial condition, First Interstate continues to sustainserious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,real estate and agriculture dominate the economy. Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,he said, \"I don\'t think it has bottomed out, because I thinkmost of the problems are real estate-related and the realestate problems are going to be with us for several years.\" Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture inthe Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate\'sfranchise operation. First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer FirstInterstate financial services in ten states. While a year ago he was considering taking his franchiseoperation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said becausemost of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion intothe Midwest must come first. Calling the franchise system, \"moderately profitable,\"Pinola said, \"It is going to take a rejuvenation of theagriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speedwe were generating before the last year or two.\" On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only bankswith minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.
