He told reporters that volumes in North America increasedsome 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pctafter being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentratingactivities on core businesses, had now been completed, henoted. But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategicacquisitions taking place \"from time to time,\" he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-taxprofits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level droppedthree pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond\'s Inc<CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring anyearnings dilution. However, it would not add much to profits, with much of thecompany\'s operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend, withUnilever NV\'s rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and UnileverPlc\'s increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line withthe change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts ofChesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he saidthat there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped torealise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough hadpaid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, whichoperates outside Unilever\'s core activities.

It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusuallylow prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demandfor both food and non-food purposes, it said. World consumption could increase by a record 2.8 mlntonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higherif the Indian government did not artificially curb domesticdemand. Oil World said it did not expect the European Community(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax wereintroduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption. Reuter',1 VEG-OIL}
{0 'Coffee producing countries must quicklymap out a fresh common strategy following the failure of theInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement onexport quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia\'s privatecoffee exporters\' association, said. Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing nowwould be to seek a unifying stand from producers, includingBrazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices. An ICO special meeting ended last night in London withexporting and consuming nations failing to agree on aresumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago afterprices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil. Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe butpredicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedlyplummet. However, he said the market should also take into accountevident factors such as Brazil\'s low stocks and the sale of thenear totality of the Central American crop. Trade sources said Colombia\'s coffee was today quoted at1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past10 years. Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understandthe true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nationsas well as for industrialized countries. It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made tosolve the problem of the developing world\'s external debt,decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repayingthose debts, he said. \"In Colombia\'s case, we watch with consternation that,while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countrieswhich support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,\"Cardenas said.

{0 'One of General Electric Co\'s biggestbusinesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasingprofits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,Wall Street analysts said. Previously, it was expected the business would peak anddecline at some point in the next five years. The improvedoutlook results from AMR Corp\'s <AMR> decision to order 40 newplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. \"Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,\" saidNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangementsfor its order of 15 Boeing Co <BA> and 25 <Airbus Industrie>twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using \"rent-a-plane leases\" that allowit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debtstructure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of theplanes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protectsAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severedownturn in the economy. From GE\'s point of view the package looks like a good dealfor several reasons, Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time ofdelivery, Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planesGE\'s financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,would have little trouble rounding up another airline thatwanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the dealappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said. GE\'s stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares bymidafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Uphamand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company \"no oneorder will have much of an effect on the stock.\" Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said theorder \"will help to maintain a good level of production andprofitability in the aircraft engine business\" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE\'s jet enginebusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrsby 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs lastyear, with well over half of the business in the militarysector, according to analysts\' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE\'s jet engine business coincideswith an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the firstquarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corpthat it has a \"unique ability\" to buy a major business andreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with otherelements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the currentquarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by theNBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in partcrediting \"significant benefits from the RCA acquisition.\" Reuter',1 EARN}

{0 'Canadian economic growth is expected toslow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture shouldkeep the country from recession, economists said. \"The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growthover the course of 1987,\" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist atDominion Securities Pitfield Ltd. Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,but down from 1985\'s four pct. In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualizedrates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in thethird quarter. \"Essentially it is a flat performance,\" said Warren Jestin,deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia. Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt ThomsonBongard Inc said \"it shows the economy is not moving along verysteadily, it\'s not a very promising number.\" \"We weren\'t surprised, we expected to see one bad quarterin Canada, but we don\'t think there will be a recession,\" sheadded. The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast byFederal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget lastmonth. He also projected the economy would expand 2.8 pct thisyear. Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth willlikely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range. Statistics Canada also reported the country\'s tradeperformance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit inthe current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrsfrom the previous year\'s shortfall of 584 mln dlrs. \"The sharp increase in the deficit originated frommerchandise trade transactions where imports continued toadvance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,\" thefederal agency said in a statement. The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billiondlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985. But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, andhelp fuel the country\'s modest expansion.

{0 'Soviet winter grains could be off toa faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry falland cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in theSoviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature toforecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next sixweeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply andfuture buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. \"From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty thatthe Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have alower crop (than last year),\" Gail Martell, chief meteorologistfor E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR\'s grain growing areas willbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome ofthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. \"Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead ofus,\" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectaresof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter cropand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, theUSDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be ableto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analystsnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcovercombined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has beendue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There\'s a good correlationbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normalin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over theentire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which thesnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, seniorforecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of thefall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring wouldrequire longer off-pasture feeding, they said. \"The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... theydon\'t have to buy (grains) now,\" a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops andif they feel that last year\'s huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was aone-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Sovietbuying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push theSoviets back into the market, weather analysts said. \"A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month anda half,\" Martell said.

{0 'Crude oil prices rallied today, movingover 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia\'s determinedeffort to support prices, analysts said. \"The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this withoutanother meeting,\" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers Inc. \"But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due toseasonal declines in demand and some cheating,\" he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attemptto get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount fromthe official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministersof the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at theCooperation Council oil ministers\' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members havingdifficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. \"They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and toprevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPECmember will allocate some of their oil sales to help membersthat lose sales,\" Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the formof loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in linenations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But itis also likely that such assistance would be provided toNigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPECpresident Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPECmeeting for fear that it would give the appearance that theDecember pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, UphamHarris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have beenoversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a shortcovering rally.\" He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, whichrefused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refinersinto the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the marketto but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideastsours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after tradingyeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into theNorth sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors todaythat Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brentfor Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vesselsbeing fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with tradesreported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members\' denials that they are producing over theirquotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPECproduction was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to lastdecember but he gave no details on OPEC production againstclaims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. \"The production probably is about their quota level andlargely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sellits oil as a result,\" Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of thecurrent rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise ifSaudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there werestill several fundamental factors, including demand, whichcould cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, saidslow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keepdemand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to riseabout 1.4 pct over 1986.

{0 'Coffee prices may have to fall even lowerto bring exporting and importing countries once more round thenegotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates andtraders said. The failure last night of International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agreeexport quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffeefutures markets today with the London May price reaching a4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne beforeending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previousclose. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from theICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hopethe negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floorunder prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb forMarch 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 centsa lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended inFebruary last year following a sharp rise in internationalprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and saidthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failedat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now itis time to go and sell coffee.\" But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plansto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop nextmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Tradesources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with aprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of publicselling tenders for coffee bought on London\'s futures marketlast year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to themarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a splitbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick forfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like averageexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation butconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" wayof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongstproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members andnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas andthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a setratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcometo participate they cannot dictate quotas which are verydifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achievedifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICOand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared toaccept the producers\' offer to abandon quotas if it provesimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them. \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and toencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock ifsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumerargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICOsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapseand how much producers will sink their differences shouldprices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 butboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if realnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet inIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces andpolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries couldbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner thanmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force duringthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas beforeOctober are unlikely, while Brazil\'s Dauster noted the ICO hascontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being feltby importers and exporters was that consumers would have beenhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it couldnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they couldshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug theseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these tolapse should lasting agreement not be found. \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after theirfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficientand we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.

In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Departmentsaid Florida\'s imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shownsharp gains to date. The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably beaffected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, onwhether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S.have caused injury. Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruitcoupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that growerprices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storageat the beginning of February were moderately larger than a yearearlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reducedsupplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processednoncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said. Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remainingsuppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as aconsequence prices have strengthened, the department said. Reuter',1 ORANGE}

The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct inreal terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.

{0 'A leaf disease affecting seven pct ofSri Lanka\'s rubber plantations may reduce output this year andraise currently depressed prices, industry officials andresearchers told Reuters. About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the RubberResearch Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus\"corenes pora\" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills theleaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if thecrisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.Last year\'s output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubberclones if no immediate action is taken. \"The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the treesseriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to usechemicals to kill the disease,\" an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday atPadukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling thefungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the StatePlantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubberland with the balance belonging to small private producers witha total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the ResearchInstitute as high yielding and recommended two years ago forplanting. Only the two state groups seriously planted theseclones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but olderPBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday\'s crisis meeting said it was decidedto uproot only some of the affected trees while others would betreated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past weekbut prices had hit their lowest since last December. \"If thereis a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,\" a spokesmanfor a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by aboutfour rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepeone-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at thisweek\'s auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the sameperiod. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an averageof 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes inDecember because of wintering in early February in producingareas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday\'s auction withthe supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber lastmonth did not raise prices as on previous occasions. \"Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed ofthe rubber we already had,\" one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts andspeculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivalsaggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winterclosures of factories and also in the hope that prices wouldease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry isthe dry spell in producing areas. \"If the inter-monsoonal rainsexpected in late March/April are delayed, we would have furthershortages,\" one official said. \"But this again could benefit prices,\" a buyer said.

It said no final decisions had been reached yet and bankshave until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma. \"On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequatecapital support for potential future exposure -- on the otherhand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capitalrequirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. AndU.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.\" At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of theso-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of acurrency or interest rate contract and an estimate of itspotential change in value due to currency or interest ratefluctuations until the contract matures. In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balancesheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one offive risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on thequality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of thecontract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, theplans showed. The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees wouldnot be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of riskweights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic nationalgovernment agencies, the proposals showed. The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spotforeign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures andoptions exchanges. It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of Englandwere keen to encourage banks to \"net\" contracts -- consolidatemultiple contracts with the same counterparty into one singleagreement to create one single payments stream.

{0 'Failure of talks on re-establishingInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last weekmay put political pressure on the United States, particularlythe State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. isunlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by\"objective criteria\", U.S. officials said. Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and headof Washington\'s delegation to the talks, told Reuters on hisreturn from London that the United States is willing to resumethe coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary. Rosenbaum said the United States will be \"flexible\" indiscussing the method of establishing objective criteria andany transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim ofestablishing an objective method of setting quotas. At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculatedby a formula incorporating a producer\'s recent exportableproduction and verified stocks, while large producers led byBrazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division ofshares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced themarket share of Brazil, by far the world\'s largest producer. Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to supportlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to complywith any future coffee quotas. He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing thecoffee policy situation following the collapse of the Londontalks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\" However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffeepolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee marketoffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,to soften the consumer position. \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil willkind of want to test the resolve of other producers andconsumers,\" said one U.S. official. The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, saidBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next fewmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure othercountries, particularly the splinter group of small producerswho differed with the major producers in London. This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from LatinAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to theU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council inthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.officials said. The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffeepolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly frompolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.officials said. El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombiaat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based onobjective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Ricajoined the splinter group, which said it would agree toobjective criteria. There is a strong feeling among some in the StateDepartment that the United States should continue to supportthe splinter group of producers who have taken thepolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objectivecriteria question, U.S. officials said. Within the consuming countries there also is expected to besome pressure to reassess positions. In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., theNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand onthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said. This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nationsto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals. However, U.S. sources said West Germany\'s support was attimes qualified and there is some concern that the EuropeanCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative toproducers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast andother African producers during the talks. A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans. While political manuevering by small producers andconsuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said thekey to any future outcome will be Brazil\'s position. U.S. officials blamed Brazil\'s intransigence for thefailure of the talks and said a more flexible position fromBrasilia would be the most important step toward agreement. Reuter',1 COFFEE}

The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghumcrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yieldsand cut the total volume of this year\'s harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,with the heaviest rains in the province\'s western sectors,between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume ofthe coarse grain harvest over last week\'s estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central SantaFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct oftotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest wasestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two toseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the1985/86 harvest.

{0 'Torrential rains throughoutArgentina\'s grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarsegrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularlyaffected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid tosoybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April orMay. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghumcrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yieldsand cut the total volume of this year\'s harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,with the heaviest rains in the province\'s western sectors,between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume ofthe coarse grain harvest over last week\'s estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central SantaFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct oftotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest wasestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two toseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year\'s volume, according toofficial figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and ninepct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowersfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year\'s figureof 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mlnand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two andfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mlnhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.

His comment echoed last October\'s Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development report on Turkey, which saidAnkara\'s case for more medium-term financing on better termswould look better if inflation were lower and the currentaccount deficit cut or turned into a surplus. \"In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sectorinvestments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as apercentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visibleimprovement in the current account deficit,\" he said.

Appropriations to government departments had been cut byeight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreignborrowing by municipalities had been restrained. \"We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to theinvestment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,\" hesaid.

{0 'Drilling for oil in California islikely to continue at last year\'s sharply reduced levelsdespite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analystssaid. Because much of the crude oil in California fields isthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have toincrease to near 1985\'s levels before any significant recoveryis seen in drilling, they said. \"Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\"said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, comparedto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger OilInformation Services, which tracks California drillingactivity. \"It\'s in the dregs right now,\" said Bolster of the state\'sdrilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increaseddrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California IndependentProducers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pactto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, priceseventually fell. Prices for California\'s marker grade, Line 63 blend, haveslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a highof about 17 dlrs. More than half of California\'s oil comes from stripperwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and thatmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel toextract, Malmgreen said. \"It\'s not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\"Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coastproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inlandwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spurextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is cloudedby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California\'s oil patch, Kern County, whichproduces about two-thirds of the state\'s oil, exploratorydrilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell ofthe state energy commission. So far this year only fiveexploratory wells have been drilled. \"I don\'t think they\'ll even get to what they did lastyear,\" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest ofthe decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in thenumber of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number ofproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 frommore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California EnergyCommission. In line with that decrease, California\'s crude oil outputfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and isexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California\'s crude oilproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrelsper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department ofConservation. \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\"Guerard said.

Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategicplanning, said management wants to stay independent. \"We arenot trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with ourstrategic plans,\" he said. That plan includes integrating five boat companies thatOutboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jonessaid all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs. An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a\"decent\" price for outboard. \"A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs ashare is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops,\" he said. Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is inregistration for a two mln common share offering with MorganStanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemicalto strike before the offering is underway. Reuter',1 ACQ}

{0 'General Motors Corp staged an explosiverally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announcedyesterday, but analysts said GM\'s future remains clouded bystiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analystsagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker\'s long term prospects. \"I\'m very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of KidderPeabody and Co. \"They\'re clearly committed to enhancingshareholder value.\" However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for thebuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker torecapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buyback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. Theannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on thestock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and atleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on agood performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said therepurchase program is not a positive. \"The buyback doesn\'t really change the earnings outlook andputs more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM willhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stockshould settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.Healy\'s numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from fourdlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM\'s share of the domesticcar and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars arenot selling as well as their competitors,\" he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from theyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> andChrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said Februarysales showed improvement over January, adding that it expectsimprovement in coming months. Overall, GM\'s share of U.S. car and truck sales should fallto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody\'s Kirnan said cost reductions and productimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by thefourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it\'s rolling upits sleeves and getting serious. I think there\'s a majorearnings surprise in the winds,\" he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, inpart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is moreconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuationwith respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said. Another positive for the stock is GM\'s dividend, currentlyfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield thanits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cashdividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Incsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM\'s new products, ifsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of itsmarket share. \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that willonly curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middleof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, hesaid results will not improve until 1988. \"I\'m not looking for improvement this year. This is atransition year for GM,\" he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will notaffect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn\'t so much what theyearn this year.

{0 'French oil group Total Cie Francaise desPetroles <TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion francconsolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986,after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, thecompany said in a communique after a board meeting here. In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli toldjournalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollarhad caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated netprofit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into aconsolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs. Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total\'srefining and distribution subsidiary Cie deRaffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France <RAFF.PA>, toldjournalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for thesubsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation andcurrency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year, taking account of thatdepreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billionfrancs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD\'s sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from20.9 mln \"due to the growth in imports by independentdistributors following a relaxation of regulations,\" Guilbaudsaid. The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a jobreduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mlnfrancs, he said.

{0 'Texas Railroad Commissioner JamesNugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait forCongress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adoptincentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severancetaxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house ofrepresentatives that the state must take the initiative inmolding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assisttroubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas\' oil industry would exemptstripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each dayfrom the state\'s 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that themajority of Texas\' oil wells fall within the stripper wellcategory and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can becrucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt newwildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five yearsas a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods ofproduction that inject water or gas into the ground to recoveroil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugentsaid. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiarywells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a dayfor three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 abarrel. \"We\'ve been sitting back and waiting on two federaladministrations to develop a coherent energy policy for thenation to follow. I say we have waited long enough,\" Nugentsaid. \"In other words, let\'s tell Washington to either lead,follow, or get out of the way.\" Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasuryby exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxeswould be more than made up by stimulating new business for theoil supply and service industry.

The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the otherfor the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce exportquotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successfuloutcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigentattitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made itimpossible. In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviriasaid the U.S. attitude would have serious economic andpolitical consequences, not necessarily for a country likeColombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and forsome African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relativelyhigh level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, whichtraditionally account for 55 pct of the country\'s total exportrevenue.

Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure toremain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captialspending will be internally financed. Guinn also told analysts that the company faced someregulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its PacificBell operating company. In rates hearings before, the California Public UtilityCommission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlrrevenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with thecommission, he said the figure might even be greater. The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlrrate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculationsand assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneededmodernization costs. Guinn also said that the company is still studying whetherto join an international consortium that plans to lay atranspacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan. \"We have not agreed to anything,\" Guinn said, but added hewould soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and thecompany would make a decision soon on participating. Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by theU.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operatingcompanies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn saidthe company would likely shy away from that type of expansion. \"(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.It\'s a commodity business and becoming more so,\" he said. \"I\'mnot so sure we would be interested in getting back into thatbusiness.\" However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for theBell operating companies to expand into non-regulatedbusinesses and provide more flexibility to form strategicalliances with other companies. He added that while the company welcomes the expansion intonew areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusitiontalks. \"We do not have anything actively under consideration,\"he said.

Redstone also said \"Viacom is committed to working veryclosely with us to obtain approvals.\" Viacom has been seekingapprovals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cablesystems since September when its management group firstadvanced a buyout plan. But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited biddingcontest which was capped by the announcement this morning thatViacom\'s independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered intoa defintive merger agreement with National. National is a family business which operates a chain ofmovie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.

He noted that the number of motionpicture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.

Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said ifCongress passed legislation to curb textile imports, whichwould hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asiantextile producers, \"the community would have to retaliate.\" His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian TradeMinister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, thecommunity would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after twodays of talks with Reagan Administration officials and membersof Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment inCongress since his visit here last year as Congress and theAdministration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. tradedeficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation toforce Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan\'s trade surplus is causing everyoneproblems - its surplus with the United States last year was51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. \"The more united pressure there could be, the better,\" hesaid. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation toavoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontationearlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain andPortugal joined the community and its liberal importsregulations were tightened to conform to EC standards. \"But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,\" hesaid, \"\"it does not mean that they would do so on anotheroccasion.\" Channon added that \"There is increasing reesentment inEurope over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressureof unilaterally imposed deadlines.\" He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft andtaxes on fats and oils - and \"the commuity and the United Statesmust therefore learn to manage their relations better.\" He said another bill to let the United States retaliateagainst a nation if that nation\'s market was not open to U.S.goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement onTariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.

Piedmont\'s board was meeting today, and Wall Streetspeculated the board was discussing opposing bids from NorfolkSouthern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortlyafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. Italso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir andthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offerfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal forUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it saidit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of theairlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairmanCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline intothe takeover arena. \"We\'re just wondering if he\'s not just trying to get TWAinto play. There\'s speculation on the street he just wants tomove onto somthing else,\" said one arbitrager. \"We think TWAmight just be putting up a trial balloon.\" Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,but that the airline will probably reject it because the priceis relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible byrevealing financing arrangements. \"They need to show theircommitment and their ability to finance. I think it\'s acredible offer,\" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. \"I think it\'s certainly on the low end of relative valuesof airline deals,\" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs wouldbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. Aspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had notchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct ofthat airline\'s stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balancefor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mlnshares. Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, alsoremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck withits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmontand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeoverof Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir tomake his own airline a more attractive takeover target. \"Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and therewere no takers. I think the strategy might have called formaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplishthat specific objective is to go out and acquire otherairlines,\" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. \"I don\'t know whose going to buy them, but at least thisway it becomes a much more viable package,\" said Kim. But Icahn\'s financing ability for such a transactionremains in doubt, in part because of TWA\'s heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to dothe offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financialadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp <X>and still retains 11 pct of that company\'s stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier\'s USX plan wasimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc, because of Wall Street\'s insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWAoffer on price and financing concerns. \"It\'s littered withcontingencies and it doesn\'t even have a financingarrangement,\" said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be astrong contender with USAir\'s east coast route system andplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed theintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence inits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA\'s pars reservationsystem. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it wouldresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share. Reuter',1 ACQ}

Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,Brazil\'s share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mlnbags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export. \"It\'s a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this wasbetter than such a quota reduction,\" he added. In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and greencoffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severedrought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under10 mln bags. Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, ofwhich 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvestthis year should be around 30 mln bags, he added. The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for lastyear\'s harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believeit was higher than this. Reuter',1 COFFEE}

Commenting on Monday\'s failure by producer and consumernations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten anoversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister DenisBra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually beobliged to restore their positions. \"I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,\" hetold a news conference here at his return from the failedLondon talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day inLondon down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, thelowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs(1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned byIvory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if theslide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world\'s biggest cocoaproducer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead anAfrican initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end ofnext month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-basedInter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf ofthe continent\'s 25 producer nations at the London talks. \"An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,\" he saidwithout elaborating. \"Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarkedon a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragilemarket,\" he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said PresidentFelix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that hisgovernment would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteedby the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that thecoffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversifyits agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent fromworld market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonightsaid that during today\'s weekly cabinet meeting, the veteranIvorian leader reaffirmed \"his faith in Ivory Coast\'s bright(economic) future\" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the governmentdecided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mlndlrs) to support the country\'s small farmers.

Talks on similar projects have beenheld with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi HeavyIndustries Co Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima HeavyIndustries Co Ltd <JIMA.T>, he said. Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twentyfoot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi,which would complete production. \"We expect the successful cooperation between us andOnomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with otherJapanese shipbuilders in the future,\" Lo said. He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost ofshipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanesetechnology and marketing. This would pose a challenge tocompetitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrssince beginning operations in 1975.

But he said the company, which is Taiwan\'s largestshipbuilder, still has full government support and had begundiversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes andother machinery. \"We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,\"he said. Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mlnU.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with theprevious financial year. He estimated income would rise to morethan 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.

Their estimates of the bank\'s net earnings for last yearranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will beannounced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for aone-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonusissue this year, probably one for three or one for five. The bank\'s 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd <HSGH.HK>is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of morethan one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrsfor a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed innerreserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of theHong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew bynearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. \"They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,as their loan portfolio is well balanced,\" an analyst at MansionHouse Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances roseby 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong\'s visible trade, the mainstay ofthe local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of fivepct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest receivedon loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank andHang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the bankingsystem, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another majorincome source for the bank group. Loans to finance propertydevelopment and instalment mortgages rose sharply. \"The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgagebusiness despite tough competition from the Bank of China groupand other foreign banks,\" one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equitiesmarkets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in HongkongBank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd <WAIA.HK> and <James Capel andCo>, analysts said. \"Wardley had a tremendous year acting asfinancial adviser and underwriter,\" an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year\'s billion-dlrflotation of <Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which HongkongBank owned 30 pct at the time. The bank\'s stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in returnfor 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stakein <South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of twoEnglish-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs. The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and willnot show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said. Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reducedneed to write off bad debts. \"The need for provisions was muchlower than the year before,\" said Tony Measor of Hong LeongSecurities Co Ltd. \"Last year\'s profits should have been 2.8 to2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.\" Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said thebank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against itsshipping exposure in 1985.

Trade figures show that the new currency alignments arealready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare internationalcooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact betweenthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut downthe value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the majorcurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in whichthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but notnecessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement tookplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreementsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert inTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. \"You have to look at the dollar\'s peak compared with now,and that was well before Plaza,\" he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention andperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, thedollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical crossrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. TheEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and tradeflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, butundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three ischanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the ECboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half ofof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exportsand 21 pct for imports in yen terms. \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have atremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unitsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is importantto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that islaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable yearin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to itsstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive thanU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rateimbalance, and which will cause problems. \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC isreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. Buttherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitiveedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First InternationalEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you wantmy objective view, I don\'t expect a drastic improvement in ourtrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,and this year we may have to do so again,\" he said. REUTER',1 YEN}

The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leadingeconomic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimisticthan that of the other institutes, some of which have recentlyreduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany\'s exportoutlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark\'sstrength against the dollar and other major currencies. \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all inall, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight risein exports can be expected.\" The institute said past experience has shown West Germanexporters will move to counterbalance currency factors bycutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjustingtheir product ranges. They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise ineconomic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, thedecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slowthis year. West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewedadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, bothof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetarypolicy, the institute said. However, it said the labour market would see only a slightimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hireadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly byagreed reductions in working hours. The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance ofmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a markedacceleration of inflation. It also warned that what it called the worldwidesynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a newglobal recession. It said central banks in industrializedcountries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the FederalReserve Board\'s expansionary course. The institute said this in turn was bound to leadeventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central bankswere likely to follow suit, causing a recession that couldaggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well asincrease protectionism around the world. Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from thenegative effects of the global synchronization of monetarypolicy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces ofgrowth at home. The institute said this could be done by ensuring thatfiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxesshould be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, andwage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower thanin 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationarypressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supplyto about four pct. REUTER',1 GNP}

{0 'Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost itseconomy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washingtonto take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remainingrestrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdownof the figure, saying it takes into account a number ofhypothetical losses. Some of them are \"too sophisticated toconvert into financial terms,\" one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions isimpossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland\'seconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they onlycontributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most FavouredNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliationfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union undermartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy wasoriginally devised several years ago by the Institute ofNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planningcommission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polisheconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growthtrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases incredits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade wasbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissingthe estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point,which has no real scientific evaluation.\" A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports tothe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrsannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions wereimposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling tradesurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrsagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland importantU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say creditsdried up for economic not political reasons. \"Poland isaccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate forpolitical reasons,\" said one expert. \"It\'s an illusion based on amisunderstanding of Western economy.\" \"There\'s a limit to how much you can go on giving someonewho has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding thatPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy creditsin the 1970s which were no longer today\'s reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" onediplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical ordersand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing ofscientific links and exchanges. Western officials say thelifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impacton Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrsand lacks the means to modernise its industry. \"MFN doesn\'t really mean anything, only that Poland will notbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult toregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces arein play now,\" said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and theirquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionistmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamperPoland\'s efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognisedthis fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Makingup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonlydifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period oftwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level ofexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\" While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says ithas a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it saysimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said\"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoingof the Polish economy won\'t cut any ice. The Americans willjust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushingSolidarity.\" Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, intalks in Washington last week with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland waslooking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet itsfinancial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a shorttime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of itsforeign economic partners.\" He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity toplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland\'s partnersinterested in the settlement of Polish debt.\" Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamedWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF andParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years andsaid it should now play a more positive role. \"As a major superpower the United States can influenceinternational organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetingsaimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent towhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.

{0 'OPEC crude oil output in the first fewdays of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpdceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oiltraders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the MiddleEast, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that thegroup is producing within its ceiling to support the return toa fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpdabove the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by theUnited Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,was also producing above quota in the first days of March, thesurvey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fallin Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran\"s inability toexport as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, wasestimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 inearly March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its shareof Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by someOPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar\'s February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar\"sprices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for anyshortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria\'s early March output was about one mln bpd, downfrom 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria\'s customers believe its Bonnygrades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudesfrom the U.K. North Sea.

{0 'Baker International corp said it hasfiled suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Coto complete its proposed merger with Baker. Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the mergeragreement because Baker would not agree to an alternativedivestiture plan devised by Hughes. Hughes\' board hadpreviously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consentdecree that would have required broader divestitures. Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanationfrom Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the JusticeDepartment consent decree. Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at whichshareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting thecounting of votes on the deal. Baker said it believes the votewas overwhelmingly in favor of the merger. Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for themerger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were \"moreburdensome\" than those of the consent decree themselves. Baker said divestitures under the consent decree wouldreduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrsor three pct. Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures ofthe units named in the consent decree. It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain ofits directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes tolive up to the merger agreement or \"substantial\" monetarydamages it did not name. Baker said it believes the merger to be in the bestinterests of shareholders of both companies. Reuter',1 ACQ}
