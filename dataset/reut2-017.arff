{0 'Quantum Fund N.V., a NetherlandsAntilles mutual fund for which New York investor George Sorosis investment adviser, said it has agreed to limit furtherpurchases of Fairchild Industries Inc stock. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Quantum, which already holds 1,647,481 Fairchild common shares,or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to therestriction after Fairchild said its security clearance mightbe jeopardized if Quantum acquires a major stake in it. But Quantum said Fairchild management was told that Soros,acting either individually or through entities other thanQuantum that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in thecompany on his own behalf. Quantum had recently notified the Federal Trade Commissionunder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild\'s voting stock.Unless the FTC had objected, Quantum would have been free, butnot obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild stock. Fairchild management, however, warned that if Quantum, aforeign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, itcould \"impair\" the government security clearances Fairchildneeds to carry out its its defense contract work. In response, Quantum said it told Fairchild it will notmake \"significant additional purchases\" of its common orpreferred stock without giving Fairchild enough prior notice toenable it to consult with Quantum over the impact of action. Quantum also said it has withdrawn its notification requestto the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Departmentof its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild. Quantum also said it told the FTC and the JusticeDepartment that it does not expect to resubmit any furthernotifications of intent to significantly raise its stake inFairchild at this time. The restrictions Quantum has agreed to follow regardingfurther dealings in Fairchild stock do not apply to Soros as anindividual investor.

Kuwait\'s Central Bank yesterday cut one key money marketrate and abandoned another which had been used since February1986 to direct inter-bank borrowing and lending costs. The bank reduced to six pct from 6-1/2 pct the rate atwhich it will offer funds of one month to one year in theinter-bank market. This, in turn, affected retail rates. The cut, the third this year, followed a major overhaul ofinterest rate policy last month which Central Bank GovernorSheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah said was designed to revivethe economy.

Despite uncertainties generated by the 6-1/2 year old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\'s northern doorstep, bankers play down theprospect of any significant capital flight. The Kuwaiti dinar, whose value is set by the Central Bankand was fixed today at 0.27095/129 to the dollar, is strongernow than for several years.

Bankers said the dollar slump hurt many investors behindthe last major capital outflow in 1984, encouraged then by 18pct U.S. Interest rates and the start of Iranian attacks onneutral shipping in the Gulf.

{0 'Congress returned from its Easterrecess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promisesto be a partisan dispute. The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reaganand Republicans is expected to get underway this week in theSenate late this week and last at least another week. It istaking on new prominence because of current trade woes. That is because the budget problems and its associated hugedeficits are said to be at the root of related internationaltrade friction currently worrying financiers. As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stockexchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the UnitedStates and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major tradewar between the two trading giants for the first time sinceWorld War II. Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan isrefusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and theresulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisionsand small computers. Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neitherside wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit. Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up tothe economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue togrow without repercussions. A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed byforeigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if theywithdraw this support the result can only be further problems,including higher interest rates for Americans. In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to theshowdown stages in Congress. Reagan\'s own trillion dollarspending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,was trounced badly in the House on April 9. The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed theHouse, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, throughdefense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrsin new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take upits own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will bepassage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle. In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan\'sRepublicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the SenateBudget Committee for full Senate consideration. A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters hebelieves this very unusual unanimous opposition was by designamong congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacitapproval of the White House. \"Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any taxhikes and defense cuts,\" he said. In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will pressfor a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget withReagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But \"it is notclear how the Republicans will act,\" he added. He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lowertaxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer afterReagan\'s budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House. When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inheritedwhat was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that woundup to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year. Despite Reagan\'s promise to balance the budget by 1983,critics note that his administration\'s record of accumulateddebt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billiondlrs. That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, andmany analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and causedthe worst U.S. trade deficit ever. Last year the United States bought goods from the worldworth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, includingpurchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods. While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on onefront through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatorymeasures unless all markets are opened, its success so faragainst the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress. Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put thedeficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30. Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget lawenacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to domore than talk about deficits. That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm ofTexas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat ErnestHollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet. The law has been followed, even though an enforcementmechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts ifCongress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court. The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. Butin reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example,Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 targetof a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving thenumbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billiondlrs -- far off the target. This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal isexpected to be missed widely. Reuter',1 TRADE}

{0 'Spanish Secretary of State for theeconomy Guillermo de la Dehesa said the government maintainedits five pct inflation target for this year although a 0.6 pctincrease in March pushed the rise in the year on year consumerprice index to 6.3 pct. De la Dehesa said the March rise, announced today by theNational Statistics Institute, was not entirely satisfactorybut acceptable. The year on year rate at the end of February was six pct.Prices rose 8.3 pct last year. The March rise included a 0.05 pct increase correcting anerror in last January\'s consumer price index. Economists hadearlier said the error could have been as high as 0.2 pct. De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushedthe index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower inApril. The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the Marchprice rise showed inflation was going up again and thegovernment looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pcttarget. The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelledunions\'s claims to wage increases beyond the government\'srecomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct.

{0 'U.S. banking data released today aretoo distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetarypolicy, but they do support the market\'s assumption that theFederal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,economists said. \"It\'s clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discountwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rateaverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistentwith a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First ChicagoCorp. Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate thatthe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct. Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-weekstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week ofDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously. Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billiondlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total thisyear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at theFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more inreserves than the Fed had anticipated. However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fedis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings thanwitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may haveforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week. First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the weekended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of theproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions topay annual income taxes. As banks\' checking-account liabilities rise, so do thereserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed. Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billiondlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economistssaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of theprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started toadd reserves too late. Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparentlyleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with whichto enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economistssaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of reposoutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to addeven more reserves but was prevented from doing so. \"It\'s not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn\'t add asmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\"said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targettingdiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct. After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has nottightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of thestatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced thatthe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today\'sfigures, he said, \"It\'s fair to say that the Fed may be movingtoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.\" Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rateunless the dollar\'s fall gathers pace. Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing politicalopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a timewhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key toreducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similartextile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. Butdespite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivalsin Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwandollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct againstthe U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won roseby some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable. Taiwan\'s textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the samethis year, Chen said.

{0 'Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party(LDP) drew up a final plan to expand domestic demand and boostimports in time for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s visit toWashington next week, LDP officials said. The plan calls for additional fiscal measures worth morethan 5,000 billion yen, a large-scale supplementary budget forthe current fiscal year started April 1, and concentration ofmore than 80 pct of the annual public works budget in the firsthalf of the year, they said. Nakasone will explain the measures to U.S. Officials duringhis visit to Washington starting April 29. The LDP plan will be the basis for a government package ofpump-priming measures expected to be unveiled in late May. The LDP said Japan should do more to reduce its tradesurplus. Its plan is expected to help increase economic growthled by domestic demand, officials said. The government was also urged to review the ceiling onbudgetary requests for investment purposes in 1988/89. Thegovernment has imposed a five pct cut in investment outlays inthe past five years in line with Nakasone\'s avowed policy offiscal reforms. The plan called on Japan to promote government purchases offoreign goods and private sector imports of manufactured goodsby improving import financing, and to make clear officialprocurement procedures for foreign supercomputers. The LDP also said Japan should contribute further tosociety at large through measures such as doubling its officialdevelopment assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs in five years or soinstead of seven years as the government had originallypromised. The government was urged to work out a program to recyclefunds from Japan\'s trade surpluses to debt-ridden countries. The officials said the funds to be recycled would includethose from the private sector and others provided through thegovernment Export-Import Bank of Japan and Japan\'s OverseasEconomic Cooperation Fund. The plan also calls for the government to take steps tohelp the development of African and other less developednations. The LDP called for adequate and flexible management ofmonetary policy, such as a cut in interest rates on depositswith the Finance Ministry\'s Trust Fund, and a tax cut topromote plant and equipment investment.

{0 'The visit this week by a specialJapanese envoy has done little to defuse Japan\'s tradefrictions with the United States, U.S. and congressionalleaders say. White House and congressional leaders took a wait-and-seestance, after a series of meetings with former Japanese ForeignMinister Shintaro Abe, who was here paving the way for theApril 29-May 2 visit of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. They are withholding judgment until Nakasone\'s visit, withone senator saying Japan had promised to stimulate its economyand open its markets to foreign goods in the past, but it wastime now for action. The U.S. trade deficit last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, with more than one-third of it in trade with Japan. Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to tryto turn around the deficit, which has cost millions of U.S.jobs and closed thousands of factories. Much of the anger has been directed at Japan. U.S.-Japan trade friction was further fueled by PresidentReagan\'s April 17 decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mlndlrs worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for unfairpractices in semiconductor trade. Reagan said he imposed the tariffs on personal computers,television sets and hand tools because Japan failed to keep anagreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets atless than cost and to open its home market to U.S. products. Abe had asked Reagan to end the tariffs quickly, but U.S.officials said the curbs would not be dropped until Japan hadshown it was honoring the pact, which could take severalmonths. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if Nakasone\'svisit might help to defuse trade tensions, said \"whetherprogress can be made depends on how you want to measure it.\" He added, \"I would expect progress to be made. If you wantto measure that in terms of lifting the sanctions, that\'s moredoubtful.\" Congressmen were equally skeptical. Abe met Senate and Democratic leaders active in tradelegislation, telling them of Japan\'s plan to spur domesticspending by 34 billion dlrs and open its markets to a widerange of goods, including supercomputers and farm products. Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, said after themeeting, \"We have heard promises in the past, but the questionnow is whether there will be real action.\" Abe also met House leaders pressing for a tough trade bill,including Congressman Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat. Gephardt is sponsoring legislation to penalize nations withlarge deficits and which are guilty of unfair trade practices. Gephardt\'s legislation would hit Japan, as well as Taiwan,South Korea, and West Germany. The bill is expected to pass theHouse next week - coinciding with Nakasone\'s visit - but itsfate in the more moderate Senate is uncertain. A bipartisangroup of senators, however, told Nakasone in a letter releasedas Abe was holding Senate meetings, that fresh Japanese-U.S.trade strife would erupt if Japan\'s markets were not soonopened to American goods. The signers included Democratic leader Robert Byrd of WestVirginia, Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas and othersranging from moderate to hardline on trade issues. They said in the letter there was growing U.S. sentimentthat Japan was fighting opening its markets and \"evidence to thecontrary is necessary to combat this perception, or it islikley that additional efforts will be attempted to close offthe American market to Japanese goods.

First quarter revenues were down 13 pct to 19.44 billiondlrs. One time items aside, Exxon said, its first quarter resultswere stronger than 1986\'s final quarter which included severallarge asset sales and positive inventory adjustments. It said earnings per share declined 36 pct reflecting thecompany\'s continued purchases of its own common for thetreasury. During the first quarter, 5,085,000 shares wereacquired at a cost of 416 mln dlrs compared with 3,132,000 in1986\'s fourth quarter. Commenting on the first quarter, Exxon said crude oilprices strengthened moderately within the quarter and werehigher than a year ago at the end of the quarter. However, average crude prices for the quarter were belowthe year ago period, leading to lower earnings for explorationand production operations, Exxon said. Also contributing to reduced earnings were lower naturalgas prices, primarily overseas, representing contractadjustments representing contract adjustments tied to fallingproduct prices in 1986, the company said. During the first quarter, the company said, intensecompetition in both domestic and international markets servedto depress margins for refined products. Exxon said the lower product margins resulted insignificantly reduced earnings for refining and marketingoperations, contrasting sharply with the unusually strongmargins prevailing in the first qtr of 1986. It said savings from efforts to control costs and improveefficiency helped soften the negative impact of lower oil andnatural gas prices.

{0 'The most likely reason for West Germanproducers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores isthat they already have, or are reasonably certain of, obtainingEuropean Community (EC) export licences for it, traders said. They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brusselssaying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1. The traders said it is also likely that French producers,who put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw asignificant proportion of this for the same reason before theyare due to accept payment for the sugar in early May. Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the levelof export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders,with generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats toleave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most ofthe old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May. The EC has so far granted licences for 2,467,970 tonnes outof around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87series of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of hightonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders andsubsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bidsfor the export licences, traders said.

The government also said in the plan, made available toReuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would dolittle to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit. The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni tookpower 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs ininvestment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991. It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrsin pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mlndlrs at a conference in Kampala last week.

About two thirds ofthe increase is likely to be washed out in the following week,\"said Kim Rupert, an economist at Money Market Services Inc. Rupert said a huge increase in M-1 for the April 20 week isimplied by very strong deposit survey data and by anunexpectedly sharp gain in required reserves in Federal Reservedata released Thursday. Those numbers, covering the two-week bank statement periodthat ended on April 22, show a 2.5 billion dlr jump in basicrequired reserves. Economists said this largely reflected theparking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock marketsales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes.Fed seasonal adjustments do not adequately compensate for theseand other special factors. Analysts noted that income tax refunds from the Treasuryalso appear to be coming earlier than usual. They also are not adequately compensated for by the Fed\'sseasonal adjustment factors to the money supply. The Federal Reserve is no longer targeting M-1 because thelink between M-1 and economic growth has largely been severedby financial market innovation and deregulation. As such, there is likely to be little financial marketreaction to the huge M-1 increase that is expected to beannounced next week. Reuter',1 MONEY-SUPPLY}

{0 'Unless U.S. refiners reduce the amountof gasoline they now produce, the oil industry will enter thecoming summer driving season with the largest surplus of motorfuel since 1984, oil analysts and traders said. \"They key question is how much gasoline refiners produce inthe coming weeks,\" said Larry Goldstein of Petroleum IndustryResearch Inc. \"If refiners cut output and demand turns upward,gasoline stocks could begin to draw, and the surplus couldpotentially turn around in four to eight weeks,\" saidGoldstein. The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. gasoline stocksfor the week ended April 17 are 37.6 mln barrels above lastyear\'s levels, and analysts said they don\'t believe theexpected one to two pct rise in demand will take care of thesurplus before the start of the summer driving season, whichbegins Memorial Day weekend. The API said the last time stocks were this high was in1984, when there was a 27 mln barrel excess. Oil traders saidthat the surplus held throughout the summer of 1984, depressingprices for the motor fuel. Over the past several weeks, analysts said they expectedrefiners to reduce production because there was no profit incontinued production of gasoline due to the surplus. However,refineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said. U.S. refineries have been running at about 78.8 pct ofcapacity during March and April this year, compared to 77.5 atthis time last year, API statistics show. Because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for amajor oil company said he believed that most companies arecontemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term. He said some refiners appear to be selling lessaggressively in order to have product on hand to meet theexpected rise in demand this summer. Goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speedlimits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible newrestrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten thesupply situation this summer. However, a planner at another major oil company said thatalthough large inventories are dampening the price outlook forgasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut outputsoon. That oil company planner said high crude oil runs reducethe refiner\'s average costs, making the incremental barrel ofgasoline cheaper to produce. Most analysts expect a slight upturn this summer over thesummer of 1986. Bo Poates, an analyst at the Energy FuturesGroup Inc said he foresees demand up about one pct in thesecond and third quarters of 1987.

In a news conference, the director of the bank\'s ForeignTrade Department (Cacex), Roberto Fendt, attributed March\'s weak performance to labour strikes. March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53billion dlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986. March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March1986. Fendt said coffee earnings were up to 220 mln dlrs in Marchfrom 110 mln dlrs in February, while oil derivatives were downto 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February. He said that although the March results were considerablylower than the same month last year, the government\'s target ofan eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. TheJanuary-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, below thesame period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs. Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt saidthe trade surplus should reach one billion dlrs in each of thelast six months of the year. Even though results in the exports of steel, shoes andfrozen concentrated orange juice were weaker compared toFebruary, Fendt said this was not an indication that the UnitedStates was retaliating on account of its dispute with Brazil inthe issue of informatics.

{0 'High labour costs and slower corporateinvestment could hinder Sweden\'s economic growth after 1987,the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development,OECD, said. The Swedish economy grew at a slower rate in 1986 than inprevious years. GDP rose about 1.7 pct in 1986 compared with2.2 pct in 1985. But this growth depended largely on externalfactors, particularly lower oil prices, the OECD secretariatsaid in its latest annual report on Sweden. It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly inSweden than in other OECD countries. Because of high labour costs Swedish industry, whichlargely relies upon export markets, was losing market share.Wages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986, inline with 1985 increases, while public sector wages rose anestimated 9.2 pct in 1986, up from six pct in 1985. This was significantly higher than average wage increasesof 3.75 pct for the seven largest members of the OECD in 1986. The report said wage moderation was central to maintainingeconomic growth in Sweden. It suggested that wage negotiationsshould be at least partly centralised to control the totalwages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels. Helped by low oil prices and the government\'s tight fiscalpolicy, inflation fell to just over three pct in 1986 fromalmost six pct in 1985 but remained higher than in most otherOECD countries, the report said. Unemployment, a principal policy target, was at 2.7 pct in1986, in line with 1985\'s 2.8 pct and well below the OECDaverage of 8.6 pct. The report said Sweden\'s employmentpolicies accounted for the high levels of wage inflation. It also said that economic growth in 1986 reliedincreasingly on private consumption because corporateinvestment in machinery and equipment had shrunk. The total volume of industrial investments dropped by twopct in 1986, with sharp declines in spending by the wood, pulpand paper industries. This compared to a 19 pct rise in 1985when there was heavy investment in these industries. The OECD said Sweden should now make an effort to boostcorporate investments and reduce its dependence on domesticconsumption for economic growth. It suggested there was roomfor reform in the tax system. Sweden should continue to cut public sector spending,especially in local government, to keep in line with itstighter fiscal policy, the report said. REUTER',1 GNP}

In a news conference, Fendt attributed the weak performancein the March trade balance to labour strikes in the country.March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53 billiondlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986. March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March1986. Fendt said that coffee earnings rose to 220 mln dlrs inMarch from 110 mln dlrs in February while oil derivatives weredown to 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February. He said that although the March results were considerablylower than the same month last year, the government\'s target ofan eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. TheJanuary-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, well below asimilar period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.

{0 'The Peruvian government\'s freeze on silversales, which has contributed to a sharp boost in the metal\'sprice, could draw retaliation by rich nations and big tradersseeking lower prices, President Alan Garcia said. Peru, the world\'s second biggest silver producer, stoppedselling its refined silver and state-marketed ore on tuesday.Since then, the metal\'s price has risen to its highest level innearly three years. It closed today at over nine dlrs an ounceon world markets. Garcia said the move showed that a small nation like Perucould move international markets and did not have to acceptcheap prices for silver, traditionally one of the top revenueearners of the country. Peru exported its refined silver last year at an averageprice of 5.40 dlrs a troy ounce. As recently as one month ago,silver bullion was trading for about 5.70 dlrs an ounce onworld markets. \"One thing is that Peru, which produces silver, sells itsilently and in a submissive manner at the price world marketswant,\" he told reporters at the presidential palace. \"The other is that a nationalist government says, \'wait amoment I can\'t sell silver at these prices,\'\" he added. The peruvian energy and mines minister, Wilfredo Huayta,said the government would maintain its freeze on new sales ofsilver until the price of the metal reaches \"the true value thisraw material should have.\" He did not specify this level. Garcia said rich nations and big traders, faced with Peru\'sstance, could try to defend themselves. \"They have some stocks, they have silver deposits, they canmake fictitious sales and that way try to make the price of ourmineral fall in the world market,\" Garcia said. \"Whatever manoeuvre they take will be answered by Peru,\" hesaid. \"Peru is in a position of action.\" President Garcia had recently spoken by telephone withMexican President Miguel de la Madrid, Huayta said. Mexico isthe world\'s biggest producer of silver. Mexico and Peru together produce nearly nearly 40 pct ofthe world\'s silver, the official newspaper El Peruano said. The newspaper added that Peruvian central bank presidentLeonel Figueroa and the head of the central bank of Mexico,Miguel Mancera Aguayo, met in Mexico City yesterday tocoordinate actions aimed at consolidating the upward trend ofthe price of the metal. Analysts in Zurich, a major silver trading centre, saidtoday the rally in silver prices was also fuelled by investorsbuying the metal to protect themselves against inflation, whichthey fear could be rekindled by the dollar\'s weakness. On an historical basis, silver is still relatively cheapcompared to gold, which some investors believe could set thestage for further rises, they said. Reuter',1 SILVER}

Bundesbank spokesmen were not available for comment. On Thursday Schlesinger said in a contribution to theHandelsblatt daily that the accommodative monetary stance inWest Germany caused by outside pressures could not determinepolicy in the long term. The improvement in West German terms of trade, providingroom for non-inflationary expansion of domestic demand inexcess of output growth, put the overshoot of central bankmoney stock in a more positive light, he said on Thursday. Central bank money stock, the Bundesbank\'s main monetarymeasure, was growing at an annual rate of 7.3 pct in March,above the 1987 three-six pct target range. Money stock overshot the 3.5-5.5 pct 1986 growth target. Schlesinger told the Frankfurter Neue Presse that the phaseof falling prices was over in West Germany. Prices might still be lower on a comparison with theirlevel one year earlier. But the cost of living index has risento 120.7 in March from its November 1986 low of 120.0,expressing a slight rise in prices, Schlesinger said. In March the cost of living was steady against February but0.2 pct below March 1986.

Agreements so far in the current West German wage round areneutral as far as inflation is concerned because of thestrength of the mark, Schlesinger said. Wage agreements in the public service and engineeringindustry were relatively high in view of the stable cost ofliving. But the higher costs would be compensated for, he said. \"I am thinking above all of the fact that in the course ofthis year we will in all probability have a stronger markagainst other currencies than last year,\" he said, adding\"Without this mark revaluation effect, we would have had to saythat the wage rise agreements were not neutral for prices.\" Schlesinger said exchange rate movements had increased thescope for redistributing wealth this year, but this developmentwas unlikely to continue in 1988. \"For this reason I cannot comment on that part of theengineering agreement which covers the coming years,\" he said.

The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted,developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farmsector exports to sustain their economies but which cannotcompete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products. \"Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so),but many countries cannot,\" said Carney. She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitudeand had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under whichto discuss the issue. Talks will now continue at the Organisation of EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), which meets next month, andat the series of discussions on a new world trading framework,begun at Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive rolein the farm talks, and that the United States was willing tosee short-term progress, as long as long-term solutions werenot affected. Canada\"s five point programme demands that farm productprices must reflect open world market prices, that any supportfor farmers incomes should not be linked to productionincentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no newfarm import barriers, and that any decisions should beimplemented collectively. The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by theindustrialised world until Canada raised it last year at theTokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers. The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism havecreated some absurd situations. For example, to protect its farmers the Japanese governmentbuys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase priceto Japanese consumers. \"So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) marketto help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make aprofit on our wheat to help pay the price support for theirfarmers,\" said Carney. The problem causes pain for many nations and increases thealready dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to U.S.,Japanese and EC banks. REUTER',1 WHEAT}
{0 'Bank profits in the Gulf oil state ofQatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks areretrenching further in one of the region\"s most overbankedmarkets. Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit forseveral foreign banks, although locally-owned operations werein some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing marketshare. <Qatar National Bank SAQ>\"s (QNB) General Manager, AbdullaKhalid al-Attiya, said: \"The economy is not improving as wehoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks.\" Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bankoperations. Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-widerecession, aggravated this year by Qatar\"s severe difficultymarketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken aheavy toll on the economy and bank profitability. As a result, the only U.S. Bank, <Citibank NA>, is thoughtto be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growinglocally based <Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only startedoperations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment. Other foreign banks have retrenched, with <StandardChartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow.<Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to localbusiness, bankers said. One banker added: \"Weak profits are here to stay for thetime being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment.\" Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last yearwhen OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return tofixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar washaving difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices. The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crudeprices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have beenrunning in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day,well down on the nation\"s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sourcessaid. Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar\"s revenue hasled to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector toprivate contractors after a marginal improvement in January. Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profitslast year, as did the introduction of minimum reserverequirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing hasalmost dried up as a traditional source of bank income. Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of thegovernment\"s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantageits rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said. The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1mln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar. But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridgingloans for the public and private sector to tide governmentdepartments and local business over the lean economic spell,Attiya said. \"Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar,\" hesaid, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community. Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest,<Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to27.5 mln riyals, while <Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>,registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985. The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly andreported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during thestart-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985. Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to wincommercial deposits previously held by foreign banks,increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks toreexamine their staffing levels and overheads. <Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branchlast year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profitin 1985 of 12,000 riyals. Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the <BritishBank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, alsofound last year a difficult climate to make strong profits. BBME\"s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985\"s resulthad been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions. \"Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while localbanks are increasing their market share,\" Farquharson said. BBME\"s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. \"We are expecting thesame level of operating profit in 1987,\" Farquharson said. Standard Chartered\"s net profit last year recovered slightlyto 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985. Staffnumbers were cut last year to reduce overheads. Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatarmeans business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopesare rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation couldprovide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest ratesmay erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore. REUTER',1 CRUDE}

U.S. Officials gave the same message to former JapaneseForeign Minister Shintaro Abe in meetings in Washington lastweek. In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Reagan said hewould tell Nakasone: \"We want to continue to work cooperativelyon trade problems and want very much to lift these traderestrictions as soon as evidence permits. Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mlndlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of traderetaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called hisstaunch anti-protectionist policies. \"In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal witha particular problem, not begin a trade war,\" he said. But Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation totry to turn round the record U.S. Trade deficit, which has costmillions of U.S. Jobs and closed thousands of factories. A vote on a trade bill sponsored by Congressman RichardGephardt is expected to come during Nakasone\"s visit. It wouldpenalise nations with large trade surpluses and which arealleged to use unfair trade practices.

{0 'Plans for a new-style EuropeanCommunity (EC) free of damaging budget wrangles receive theirfirst full review from EC foreign ministers today, but areunlikely to gather much support. Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticismof proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budgetpayments by bringing member states\" contributions more into linewith national wealth. They said the EC\"s current paymasters, Britain, France, andWest Germany, would lead the opposition to the plans, designedto enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s. Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least fivebillion dlrs, EC Commission President Jacques Delors called inFebruary for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system. Such action was necessary, he argued, to end a damagingcycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technologicalresearch programs and regional and social spending projects. Ironically, diplomats said, the move could spark exactlythe type of row it was intended to avoid with industriallydeveloped northern states demanding assurances the new cashwould not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members. Delors\" plans, by linking a country\"s contributions to itsGross National Product (GNP), would over the next five yearsadd some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion. Currently, contributions are calculated on a percentage ofValue Added Tax (VAT) returns. Under the new scheme, all countries would pay one pct oftheir VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raisedin line with needs by a levy on the difference between acountry\"s total VAT receipts and its GNP. London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries tothe scheme, arguing instead that money should be made availablefrom deep cutbacks in the EC\"s heavily-subsidised farm sector. Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support thewearisome budget wrangling, taking the line that the highlydiverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions whenforced to do so. The issue is further complicated by a possible generalelection in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannotseriously be addressed by London until those polls are out ofthe way.

The offer values Monier\'s current issued capital of 156.28mln shares at 547 mln dlrs and compares with the latest sharemarket price of 2.80 dlrs, equal to last Friday\'s close. Monier recently said it proposes to make a one-for-twobonus issue before June 30. CSR will shortly announce further details of the offerincluding a CSR share alternative, it said in a statement. CSR said it currently holds 323,000 Monier shares or only0.21 pct of the company\'s issued capital. Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, the holder of 49.87 pct of Monier,has agreed with CSR that Redland will not accept the offer forits stake initially, CSR said. Instead, CSR has granted Redland two alternative options,the first giving Redland the right to accept the CSR offer atthe same price within six months of the closing date of thebid, the company said. The second grants Redland the option to increase its Monierholding to 50.1 pct in the same period. The second option is exercisable by Redland at 3.50 dlrs ashare, CSR said. Both option deals are subject to the approval of Moniershareholders except CSR and Redland. As previously reported, Redland and Monier had beendiscussing a possible Redland bid for Monier but the talksbroke off two weeks ago. CSR said Redland supports the CSR offer as a means ofestablishing a fruitful joint venture in building materials inwhich they both have interests. At the end of the offer, theywill discuss how these interests may be developed. Redland has indicated that it would be prepared to considerat a later stage an increase in CSR\'s Monier stake to enable itto become a CSR subsidiary, assuming Redland exercises thesecond option, CSR said. It said the offer is generous because it will give Moniershareholders a price equivalent to 16.8 times after-taxearnings in 1985/86 ended June 30, a 25 pct premium overFriday\'s market price and a 125 pct premium over last reportednet tangible asset backing per share of 1.57 dlrs. The offer is beneficial for both CSR and Moniershareholders, CSR\'s chief executive officer Bryan Kelman said. \"The acquisition will broaden CSR interests in buildingmaterials by the addition of complementary domestic andoverseas businesses in concrete and clay tiles, metal roofingmaterials and concrete blocks and piping,\" Kelman said in thestatement. \"Importantly, the acquisition will provide CSR with newgrowth opportunities in building materials both in Australiaand overseas,\" he added.

The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow abouthalf the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland caneareas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December. The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, justto the north of the Mackay region on the central Queenslandcoastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshenedthe crop there. Owing to the dry spell in the Mackay and Burdekin areas,the overall 1987 Australian cane crop is likely to be below the25.4 mln tonnes crushed in 1986 for a 94 net titre raws outturnof 3.37 mln tonnes, he said. But any decline will not be as great as seemed likely acouple of months ago when it appeared the Mackay-Burdekin cropswere going to suffer badly, he said. Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be availableearly next month, the spokesman said. The crush in the Mackay-Burdekin is likely to start laterthis year, in late June or early July against mid-June lastyear, to allow the cane to grow and sweeten further, he said. The crush normally runs to around the end of December. Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, withsome mill areas expecting record crops, he said.

{0 'Central bank money stock was growingat about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987, down from9-1/2 pct in the second half of 1986, so there are signs thatthe pace of growth is slowing even though it is still abovetarget, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report. The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pctgrowth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 forcentral bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct,outside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range. The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 waslimited by a series of external factors. These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreignpayments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows. The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshootin 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion withinterest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upwardpressure on the mark, it said. The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realisticif a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form wereinvested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds orforeign securities, the Bundesbank said. But if companies and private households continue to holdtheir funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currencyinflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range. \"The more the conflict between external constraints anddomestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this atthe time of writing this report -- the more possible it will beto do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supplycontrol,\" the Bundesbank said. It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards againat the start of 1987. There would be virtually no easing of other productioncosts in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit-wage costs. \"Nevertheless, no inflationary trends are likely to set inthis year,\" the Bundesbank said. A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifyingprice rises can only be observed in the long term, it added. The continuing trend for non-banks to switch into long-termborrowing to take advantage of low interest rates, while forthe same reason shunning long-term investments, increases therisks in changing interest rates for banks refinancingthemselves with variable-interest deposits, it added.

{0 'A top United Arab Emirates (UAE)banker said a new law would be introduced soon obliging courtsto recognise interest rates contracted between bank andborrower. Sheikh Suroor bin Sultan al-Dhahiri, Chairman of Abu DhabiCommercial Bank, told reporters after the shareholders\' meetinglast night the decree would make interest in debt cases payableat the contracted rate up to the day a case is filed in court. Subsequently, interest would be charged at a maximum ninepct for personal and 12 pct for corporate loans, he said. The law, if passed, would mark a breakthrough in solvingwhat UAE bankers say is one of their biggest problems,collecting bad debts in court. Under current UAE law in all emirates, except Dubai, courtsrecognise only simple interest at a maximum nine and 12 pcteven if a loan was contracted at higher compounded rates. The Central Bank said last year that roughly a quarter oftotal loans in the UAE banking system were non-performing.Sheikh Suroor also said a judicial committee set up to considerdebt cases would begin functioning within a month.

{0 'Attempts to hold currency ratesrigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary Systemintramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringingfunds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates stillconsidered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said. \"The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weakertendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatoryintervention when rates hit band limits,\" it said in its 1986annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansioncould be caused in the stronger currency nation without itscentral bank being involved in the activity. \"For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as muchroom for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when acurrency is in a phase of weakness,\" the Bundesbank said. \"In addition, speculative positions are made more expensiveto hold when interest differentials are increased.\" In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of theextent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention thathas taken place since the foundation of the eight-currencysystem on March 13, 1979. Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS centralbanks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against anotherparticipating unit. Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreementbetween central banks when speculative pressure moves acurrency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet benear any allowed EMS limits. At the start of this year, central banks were very activelyselling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily theFrench franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew. But the announcement by the Bank of France that it wasceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight toits then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100. Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banksbought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986realignment until the selling petered out on July 7. But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginaland 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention. The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the totaleventually filtered into the West German monetary system. Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, theBundesbank said, without naming the banks involved. Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in theperiod up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as thedollar surged. This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion fromJuly 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oilprices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixedprice OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demandhave been in equilibrium since March. If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second halfof the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPECproducers have not been able to produce more oil at currentprices, he said. But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mlnbarrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over thelast two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or twomln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries, particularlythe U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, butsome of that slack will be taken up by increased production inCameroon, India and other developing countries, he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oilproducers and consumers in the industrialized world for theupper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlierspeech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company. \"If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resumeits former role in world oil markets,\" he said. \"But don\'t expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30dlrs a barrel, at least not in the next three or four years,\"Subroto said.

The volume of exports to the United States hasbeen cut, while U.S. Imports have increased. But Japanese imports from Europe and other Asian nationshave recently surged, those from the United States remain weak,indicating a lack of U.S. Competitiveness, he said.

The board said, however, that Thailand may export more ricelater this year, especially to Africa, the Middle East andAsia, due to lower production in many drought affected Africancountries and to expected small exportable surpluses in Burmaand Pakistan. It said Thai rice exports to nine major African buyers roseto 351,889 tonnes during the first quarter from 93,038 a yearearlier. REUTER',1 RICE}

The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversionin Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due tocurrency movements over the past two years, it will move toprevent it, he said. Over the period, the yen has risen against the dollaralmost eight times as fast as against the European CurrencyUnit, he said. Japan has set an unofficial, voluntary 10 pct rise in carexports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop itsrising trade surplus with the Community, which hit a record 18billion dlrs last year. But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumpedover 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales, and aseven per cent fall globally. \"We think there is some diversionthere,\" said de Clercq.

{0 'Oil prices have stabilized in worldmarkets and demand is likely to increase in the second half ofthe year, Indonesia\'s Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said. He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oilprices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixedprice OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demandhave been in equilibrium since March. If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second halfof the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPECproducers have not been able to produce more oil at currentprices, he said. But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mlnbarrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over thelast two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or twomln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries, particularlythe U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, butsome of that slack will be taken up by increased production inCameroon, India and other developing countries, he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oilproducers and consumers in the industrialized world for theupper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlierspeech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company. \"If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resumeits former role in world oil markets,\" he said. \"But don\'t expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30dlrs a barrel, at least not in the next three or four years,\"Subroto said.

The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritativeSaudi sources as saying the Kingdom\'s oil price policy wouldnot change \"unless and until there is a strong revival in thegrowth of demand for oil.\" MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi pricehawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources. The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on thelong-term need to restore the competitive position of oil ingeneral and OPEC oil in particular against other energysources. \"Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with itsOPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint tomaintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level,\" MEESsaid. The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeksof April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mlnbarrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week,causing the month\'s average to be below quota, MEES said. MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures forMarch and Reuter estimates for March. It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd thismonth to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, withan OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this monthto two mln bpd, not including \"war relief\" supplies from Kuwaitand Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said.

{0 'Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone,beleaguered by political turmoil at home, sets out Wednesday ona tough mission to Washington aimed at defusing the mostserious U.S.-Japanese trade tension in recent memory. Two rounds of talks between President Reagan and Nakasone,scheduled for Thursday and Friday, come on the heels of theimposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on Japanesegoods for the first time since World War Two. In the past, bilateral trade friction involving cottongoods, steel, television sets, textiles and cars have endedwith Japan taking on voluntary export curbs. Nakasone\'s visit could coincide with the passage of aprotectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives. A proposed amendment to the bill, drafted by RepresentativeRichard Gephardt of Missouri, will mandate a 10 pct annualreduction in the trade surpluses of Japan and other nationswhich have large trade gaps with the United States. The United States last year had a record trade deficit of169.8 billion dlrs and Japan accounted for about one-third. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said recentlyhe was reasonably optimistic about the results of talks betweenthe two leaders. Top U.S. and Japanese officials have shuttled back andforth across the Pacific to lay the groundwork for Nakasone\'svisit. The last of the talks leading up to the main event willbe in Washington next Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz and Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari. Nakasone will have an economic package worked out by theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and by an advisory bodyled by former Bank of Japan Governor Haruo Maekawa. Japan plans to spend over 5,000 billion yen to boostdomestic demand, increase imports of U.S. products includingsupercomputers and give more help to developing countries,government officials said. The government has been making last ditch efforts in timefor Nakasone\'s trip to address outstanding bilateral issues,officials said. The issues include foreign access to a new Japaneseoverseas telecommunications venture and a six billion dlrinternational airport project in western Japan. Nakasone and his party last week reached a compromiseaccord with opposition parties over a controversial sales taxplan in exchange for parliamentary passage by the Lower Houseof a government draft budget for 1987/88. The accord, offered by House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara,virtually killed the Nakasone-sponsored plan, but left room forfuture tax reform plans, political analysts said. Nakasone, who led his party to a resounding electoraltriumph last July, saw his popularity drop because of the salestax. His party suffered setbacks in an Upper House by-electionand nationwide local elections in the past two months. Mitsuru Uchida, professor of political science at WasedaUniversity, told Reuters: \"I doubt that whatever Nakasone doesin Washington -- no matter how good it might be -- would helprestore his weakened power-base at home.\" Many analysts said Nakasone might step down after theVenice summit of industrialized nations in June.

{0 'Attempts to hold currency ratesrigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary Systemintramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringingfunds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates stillconsidered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said. \"The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weakertendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatoryintervention when rates hit band limits,\" it said in its 1986annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansioncould be caused in the stronger currency nation without itscentral bank being involved in the activity. \"For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as muchroom for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when acurrency is in a phase of weakness,\" the Bundesbank said. \"In addition, speculative positions are made more expensiveto hold when interest differentials are increased.\" In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of theextent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention thathas taken place since the foundation of the eight-currencysystem on March 13, 1979. Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS centralbanks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against anotherparticipating unit. Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreementbetween central banks when speculative pressure moves acurrency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet benear any allowed EMS limits. At the start of this year, central banks were very activelyselling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily theFrench franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew. But the announcement by the Bank of France that it wasceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight toits then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100. Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banksbought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986realignment until the selling petered out on July 7. But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginaland 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention. The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the totaleventually filtered into the West German monetary system. Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, theBundesbank said, without naming the banks involved. Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in theperiod up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as thedollar surged. This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion fromJuly 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}
{0 'Four trade ministers ended aweekend meeting with a frank confession that their governmentsare losing credibility in world financial markets and will notregain it until they back their promises over trade andcurrencies with action. \"Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came toaction required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,\"Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference. \"From now on, if a government comes up with a certainpolicy, it must be followed by action,\" he said following twodays of informal talks with the trade ministers of the UnitedStates, the European Community and Canada in central Japan. Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leadingindustrial powers that currencies should be stabilised tounderpin world trade. \"We need credibility to gain confidence. When we haveconfidence, then we can have an impact,\" said Tamura. His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations foughtover trade issues while calling for each other to honour freetrade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspiredconfidence in the markets. \"The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If youbelong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, ifyou want to be credible,\" said EC external trade chief Willy deClercq. Pat Carney of Canada said \"We are meeting in a time of greattrade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have thepolitical will to deal with these problems we face.\" She said that next month\'s meeting of the Organisation ofEconomic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leadersof the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum toshow this will existed. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the newsconference that the results of such high level meetings couldlead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing outworld trade imbalances perhaps years later. \"The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetingslike this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way itshould be pursued,\" he said. \"What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceedswhat is achieved in a tangible way,\" he said. Progress in personal contacts and understanding eachothers\' positions and policies was just as important towardreducing trade tensions, he said. Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential, but currencymovements alone would not correct a U.S. trade deficit withJapan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr ECdeficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplusof almost 90 billion, he said. Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible exportrestraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows weremost dangerous, he said. The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policiesover a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrialmeasures, and in line with a body of internationally agreedrules, he said. In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-basedGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must bestrengthened, he said. The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises tosolve the problem. The United States will try to reduce itslarge budget deficit and restore competitiveness within itsindustries.

The statement said the government, state agencies and otherpublic institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars,computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical andlaboratory equipment and other products. \"This amounts includes89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originallyreflected in their budgets,\" it added. The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethyleneand other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics andshipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations. Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had alreadybought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn andsoybeans. This meant the country would buy from the United Statesnearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports ofsuch commodities this year, they said. The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs,accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrainexports and cut export financing, the statement said. South Korea will also reorganise the country\'s 3,600 tradeagents to deliver better after-sales services for importedproducts and hold a trade show in November for U.S. Products. Reuter',1 SOYBEAN}

Some experts believe that a half-point increase in the U.S.discount rate, preferably in conjunction with rate cuts inTokyo and Bonn, would be enough to discourage sellers. But many fear that more drastic action, such as a U.S.issue of yen-denominated Treasury bonds, may be needed. Despite official warnings about the dangers of a furtherdollar decline and concerted central bank intervention, thedollar extended its recent sharp depreciation, touching a40-year low of 137.25 yen in Tokyo earlier today after closinghere on Friday at 139.30/40. The impact on other financial markets was devastating. In Tokyo, the stock market suffered its largest single daydecline; in London, gold bullion prices rose to four-year highsand in the U.S., long Treasury bond yields surged above 8.80pct and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 40points in hectic early trading. \"The problem now is linkage. This is not just a currencyproblem. It is affecting all the markets,\" said one seniortrader at a major U.S. bank. Up until September of last year, international efforts toredress world trade imbalances appeared to working like adream; the dollar was falling in an orderly manner, worldinterest rates were tumbling and inflation was kept in check. In recent months, however, this strategy has begun to showsigns of severe stress, with the U.S. imposition of punitivetariffs on Japan threatening to unravel this spirit ofcooperating and condemn the world to a damaging trade war. \"The markets fear that we have built up a momentum that isreally difficult to stop. A U.S. rate hike has become aninevitability,\" one currency dealer said. \"At this point, nothing short of a Fed discount rateincrease, ideally combined with further discount rate cuts byJapan and Germany, would seem capable of stabilizing thedollar,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc predicted a 1/4to 1/2 point U.S. rate increase before May 19 and a rise inU.S. bank prime lending rates to eight pct from 7-3/4 pct inthe near future. But many economists feared that any moderate U.S. rateincreases, which appear unlikely to be matched by rate cutsoverseas, would be too little, too late. \"They should have done this 10 days ago.

It would show policy weakness notstrength,\" added one trader. In addition, economists fear that a discount rate risemight place additional strain on a sluggish U.S. economy andtempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate. A U.S. discount rate increase would also fuel theprotectionist fires in Washington, where the House is expectedto pass a protectionist trade bill, whatever compromisesPresident Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone can come up withduring their summit later in the week. \"Politically, they can\'t really do it this week,\" said onecurrency analyst, pointing out that if it failed to stabilizethe dollar, it would only weaken the U.S. negotiating stance. Even if the U.S. retains the upper hand, economists andtraders do not hold out high hopes for any major newinitiatives from this week\'s talks. At best, the experts see some sort of accord whereby Japanwill agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets tooutsiders while the U.S. promises to lift its tariffs andsupport the Group of Seven dollar stabilization agreement. But many fear that this may not be enough to assuage themarket\'s speculative selling fervor, which has now raised fearsof weak overseas interest at next week\'s quarterly U.S.Treasury refunding program. Japanese and European investors have traditionally playedan active role in these auctions, which are expected to total28 to 29 billion dlrs. Consequently, thoughts are turning to the possibility thatPresident Reagan may try to remove foreign investors\' worriesabout currency risk by financing part of the U.S. budgetdeficit in yen or mark bonds, rather than dollars. While similar action by former President Carter helped tostabilize the dollar in 1978, the White House is clearlyreluctant to take such a step, economists said.

In a speech at the World Petroleum Congress here, Rawl saidoil companies would increasingly be forced to turn to enhancedrecovery techniques, very heavy oil and synthetics tocompensate for substantial declines in conventional oilproduction. \"What our current outlook suggests is that total worldenergy consumption will continue to grow steadily in an evermore energy efficient world,\" Rawl said. But, he added, Exxonprojects that \"despite today\'s ample supplies, the world willalso be facing up to inherent limitations on the availabilityof oil and gas, which currently supplies more than half of theworld\'s energy needs.\" The Exxon chairman told some 1,500 oil executives fromaround the world that some synthetics projects could becomepractical when oil reaches 30 dlrs to 40 dlrs a barrel range inreal terms. \"The question is when and how this will happen,\" he said.\"I believe that synthetic projects will not only re-emerge butwill become commercial well below those we were thinking aboutthe last time oil prices moved substantially higher.\" Rawl said synthetic fuel would become economic at lowerprices because companies are investigating \"a new generation ofideas that promise substantially lower costs\" and projectsbegun in the late 1970s, which have since been suspended. Rawl also said companies must find new and more effectiveways of enhanced recovery from existing oil fields. \"It would be my view that new oil discoveries, even withadvanced technology, are likely to slow down - not reverse -the decline in worldwide oil discoveries,\" he said. \"So it isessential to find a better way to recover more of thediscovered oil from producing fields using chemicals, solvents,heat, and other techniques.\" Rawl emphasized that private oil companies need someassistance from government in developing synfuels technology.\"More importantly, they need to provide a political andeconomic environment that is stable enough to allow thedevelopmental process to function effectively, he said. Rawl also said stable energy markets serve the bestinterest of producing and consuming nations by allowing bothgroups to plan for steady economic growth. He did not make any oil price prediction, saying only thatthe economic goals of the U.S. and other nations can only beachieved if world oil prices \"stabilize within a reasonablerange.\" \"Prices must be high enough to meet realistic aspirationsfor income and encourage resource development in the producingcountries, but not so high as to inhibit economic growth inconsuming nations,\" he said.

{0 'Blocking Canadian gas importswould not serve the long-term interests of the United States,said Martha Hesse, chairman of the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission, adding that the development of a freely open NorthAmerican energy market should be encouraged. \"I firmly believe that the long-term interest of U.S.consumers would not be served by any attempt to promote a \'Madein America\' label for gas,\" she said at an oil and gasconference. She said the commission recognizes the important roleCanadian gas plays in the American market, despite grumblingsamong U.S. domestic producers of the competition from north ofthe border. Recent figures show Canada shipped 2.48 billion Canadiandlrs worth of gas to the U.S. in 1986, down sharply from the3.91 billion dlr total in 1985. \"But we do seriously recognize the importance in the yearsto come of the supplies of Canadian gas to U.S. markets,\" shesaid. \"And even in the short term, competition is generally agood thing,\" she added. She said the commission is concentrating on improving theaccess to U.S. pipelines, something that would be of greatbenefit to Canadian producers. Hesse said transportation of Canadian gas is alreadyimproving, gas imports rising more than 21 pct in the first twomonths of the year. But Hesse declined to comment in detail onthe controversial December order, known as the \"as billed issue\",because it is the subject of a new hearing. The order, which is being fought by Canada, involvesbarring U.S. pipeline companies and consumers from payingcertain Canadian shipping expenses. Hesse said the order was never intended \"as an attempt toextend the arm of U.S. regulations across the border.\" However, a senior Canadian government energy officialwarned delegates the ruling could severely weaken Canadian gasproducers. \"Besides the extra territorial effect, there is thepotential that Canadian consumers and producers may end upsubsidizing the cost of transportation services originallyincurred on behalf of U.S. customers,\" said Robert Skinner, anassistant deputy minister in Canada\'s energy department.

But that stance will be difficult to maintain because Japanwill resist the pressure fiercely and because some U.S.suppliers of those commodities have an interest in maintainingthe quotas, U.S. and Japanese officials told Reuters. Twice in the past, the United States has negotiated withJapan on beef and citrus import quotas -- during the Tokyoround of multilateral trade negotiations in 1978, and inbilateral talks in 1984. Each time the U.S. demanded an end to the quotas at theoutset but ultimately accepted substantial increases instead.The current agreement calls for an increase in high qualitybeef imports to 58,400 tonnes in fiscal 1987, oranges to126,000 tonnes and orange juice to 8,500 tonnes. Lyng has said repeatedly that this time the United Stateswill not settle for simple increases in the quotas. Japan hasbeen given plenty of time to reform its agricultural supportsystem and the quotas must be scrapped, Lyng said. Japanese officials want to begin informal talks on beef andcitrus in August or September in Hawaii, sources said. If the U.S. intends to press its tough stance, and Japan,as expected rejects the demands, the issue may then be put tothe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for settlement,which would mean prolonging the friction beyond the April, 1988deadline set by the U.S., officials said. In interviews here, Japanese officials insist that on beefthey will not liberalize imports, regardless of the U.S.pressure, because the Japanese beef industry is not competitiveand would be damaged by freer trade. Most Japanese beef production still tends to be on smallfarms which Japanese officials said must be protected fromcheap imports by use of the quota system.

This is because U.S. oranges do not directly compete withsmaller Japanese mandarins, officials said. But Japan wants tomaintain quotas on orange juice because it fears imported juicetastes better and would displace Japanese mandarin orangejuice, they said.

Lyng has acknowledged that liberalization of beef andcitrus imports is a difficult objective, but he insisted duringthe week-long tour here that it is a high priority on theU.S./Japan agriculture agenda-- more important than the riceissue which received most of the attention. Asked about the ambivalence of some in U.S. agribusiness,Lyng noted some interests on both the U.S. and Japanese sidehave benefited from quotas but this will not stop theadministration from pressing for liberalization. And Lyng said the administration believes it can marshallmore support for eliminating the quotas now than ever before,because of concern about Japan\'s rising trade surplus. \"We\'re coming at this one (beef and citrus negotiation)with a much stronger view coming out of Washington. The timeshave changed. The trade balance is much worse,\" Lyng said. Reuter',1 ORANGE}
{0 'The sliding value of the U.S. dollarmay soon force the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries to raise its oil benchmark price, setting the stagefor prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend, topexecutives with U.S. oil companies said. The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel wasestablished by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling. But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar, thecurrency used by OPEC for its oil sales, is making the 18 dlrprice difficult to sustain, said Fred Hartley, chairman ofUnocal Corp <UCL>. The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct sinceDecember and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during thepast two years. Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oilprices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25dlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988. \"I think June will be the critical month to see what theydo,\" said Hartley, who was in Houston to attend the WorldPetroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting inJune which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestionsthat oil should be priced according to a basket of worldcurrencies instead of the U.S. dollar. E.H. Clark, chairman of <Baker Hughes Inc>, said the Saudikingdom\'s need to generate revenues -- rather than greaterworld demand -- would drive any price increases. \"The Saudis have made committments and have a balance oftrade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But theU.S. dollar won\'t buy as much as it did five or six monthsago,\" Clark said in an interview. \"I\'m betting on the Saudiking\'s need to sustain revenues.\" Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs abarrel by January one. However, the authoritative Middle East Economic Surveyreported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increaseOPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth. Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was basedon the longterm need to restore the competitive position ofOPEC oil against other energy sources. Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increasein world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the nextfew years. Michel Moreau, a director of the <Elf Aquitaine Group>,said he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached aconsensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel werenecessary to cover exploration costs, royalties and taxes onnew production. The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if thecash-strapped nations of Nigeria, Egypt and Gabon refrain fromdiscounting oil prices or increasing production levels, Moreausaid. \"I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect, theproduction agreement will fall apart,\" he said. \"But thisthreat is the Saudis\' big stick to keep producers in line.Nobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986.\" Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp <XON>, told Reutershe expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of1987, adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility. Other major companies are taking a more cautious view ofprices, fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset thecartel\'s production agreement. \"This is a year of testing,\" said Alfred Munk, manager offoreign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN). \"If they fail, there maybe a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel.\" French-owned Total CFP\'s vice president Pierre Vaillaudsaid, \"Demand is not going up very quickly, at best maybe onepercent a year. You can\'t change the price with just one pct,\"Vaillaud said. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

{0 'The prospect of renewed assaults onthe dollar might force the United States eventually to unveildistasteful measures to bolster support for its currency,monetary analysts and economists said. Treasury Secretary James Baker has acknowledged that theReagan administration discussed the possibility of issuingyen-denominated U.S. government bonds to support the dollar. But he has also dismissed speculation that he was ready totake such an unusual step. Nonetheless, monetary sources saythe issue has been seriously discussed by the administration. \"It is unlikely that we would undertake to do that now,\"Baker said last week. \"In our view there might well be some whowould view (issuing U.S. yen bonds) as, in fact, a lack ofconfidence by the U.S. in its own currency. And therefore wedon\'t think it\'s an appropriate thing to do.\" But if the Reagan administration did announce measures,they could be a part of an internationally-coordinated effortto end the instability in financial markets with genuine actionto reduce massive economic imbalances, monetary analystsbelieve. And, like a currency defense package unveiled by the Carteradministration, issuing yen bonds could be accompanied by arise in the discount rate, now 5.5 pct. The Federal Reserve has resisted pressure to raise this keyrate so far, chiefly, some Fed officials say, because it couldhurt economic growth. Another concern is the fragileinternational debt situation. Analysts who expect a currency support package are dividedover its possible timing. Some even believe an announcementcould come this week during a visit to Washington by JapanesePrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. \"It would give some real focus to the visit, and it mightsteady the dollar and prevent it from going down,\" said CharlesTaylor, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. But monetary sources said they thought it unlikely that theReagan administration would resort to measures which wouldbring to mind the troubles of President Carter. Until very recently, the current administration has urged alower dollar to help redress its huge trade deficit whileCarter faced a weak dollar as confidence in his economicpolicies collapsed. But today, Washington\'s policies areincreasingly in question. The Carter plan was unleashed on Nov. 1, 1978. And it was aresounding success. \"This package really gave credibility to theadministration to get the dollar up,\" said Robert Hormats,vice-president of Goldman Sachs Inc and a former senior U.S.economic in the Carter and Reagan Administrations. The dollar then stood at just under 1.87 marks and around188 yen. Today it stands around 1.79 marks and 139 yen. \"The problem is now that the administration in rhetoric isevidencing concern about the dollar but in practice is reallydoing very little,\" Hormats said of statements to support thedollar by U.S. officials. Several currency traders and foreign central bank officialsthink these statements still fall short of unequivocally sayingthe dollar has declined far enough. Carter issued 6.4 billion dlrs of mark and swiss francbonds aimed essentially at buttressing pyschological supportfor the dollar but also at attracting foreign investors, whohad lost confidence in the dollar, to U.S. government notes. The package was supported by a one pct rise in the discountrate, to 9.5 pct, drawings on U.S. monetary reserves at theInternational Monetary Fund and sales of U.S.-held SDRS toother IMF members. It was also supported by increased Fed currency swap lineswith other central banks and stepped up official U.S. goldsales. Stephen Axilrod, a former Fed official who is nowvice-chairman of Nikko Securities, said, \"I think it\'s veryunlikely they would do that now.\" He argued that it was politically difficult to take actionto support the dollar while Japan and West Germany have stillto fulfill pledges to stimulate their economies. But most analysts believe a currency support package wouldonly work if genuine economic measures to redress world tradeimbalances are undertaken by the leading industrial powers. It could coincide with the June Venice summit of leaders ofthe seven major industrial democracies -- the United States,Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.

{0 'The offshore oil drilling industrywill attract increasing numbers of government connected firmsin the 1990s, according to Ronald Tappmeyer, Vice Chairman ofReading and Bates Drilling Co. Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference thatcontract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation thatoil producing companies reached when their oilfields werenationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia. He said local connections to the nation whose waters arebeing drilled was an increasingly important factor in themarket. \"We have seen contractors put at competitive disadvantagesin nations in which they had worked successfully for yearsessentially moved aside to make room for locally-owned firms ora locally-built rig,\" he said. Tappmeyer, who is president of the InternationalAssociation of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trendwould spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism. He added that international contractors will increasinglyfind their role restricted to regions that require specialexpertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severeenvironments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters. Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies toprovide the main financing for offshore drilling in the comingdecade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposingthemselves and drilling contractors will have difficultyproviding financing out of cash flow. At the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirectas he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owningbusiness. He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed upby work commitments to guarantee the payoff of constructioncosts. For the time being, he said there was a superabundance ofrigs. But he said there will be a need for new, technologicallyadvanced rigs within a few years. He said the floating-drilling rigs were most likely tobenefit from new developments in technology, adding that by2,000 there should not be an ocean left that is too deep, toocold, too stormy or too remote to be explored.

{0 'A Soviet geologist said scientists needto coordinate data about onshore and offshore oil deposits tohelp identify global formations that would indicate otherpotential discoveries of oil and gas reserves. Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich, the head of petroleumgeology at Moscow State University, told delegates at the WorldPetroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also beimproved through new and more sophisticated technology. \"We should emphasize that when having the data aboutpetroleum distribution onshore and offshore, it is possible toclarify the idea of global regularities in oil and gasprospects,\" Semenovich said. \"However, much work should be doneto coordinate data concerning the structure and oil and gasprospects in adjoining onshore and offshore basins.\" Sharing the information could help geologists betterpredict regional trends and underground formations thatindicate the presence of oil or gas, he said. Semenovich also said that existing estimates of thepotential oil and natural gas resources of the world may needto be revised upward as oil companies continue to examineunexplored regions. The world, which has already produced 476 billion barrelsof oil and gas, has a current total of about 733 billionbarrels in proved reserves. Undiscovered resources areestimated at about 1.4 trillion barrels, or about half of thetotal ultimate reserves, Semenovich said. \"There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the worldand, as far as the already known basins, one continues to findadditional reserves,\" he said, noting that Antarctica has beenvirtually ignored. \"The existing estimate of potentialresources of the world may need to be enlarged.\" To find deeper and more expensive reserves, scientists willneed to use 3-D mapping of underground formations and laserspectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among othertechniques, he said. He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13pct of all offshore reserves. Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oiland gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would bediscovered and placed in production during the next 50 years. After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oilproduction was increasing. \"The difficulties of 1985 have beenovercome and we\'re now back to normal production,\" he said. The Soviet Union, the world\'s largest producer of oil, hadexperienced drilling and technical problems that cut totalliquids production from 12.45 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 12.1mln barrels a day in 1985. Last year, the Soviets produced anestimated 12.3 mln barrels. When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coalgasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich saidthe project was important because of the lack of oil reservesin the region. Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oilprices the coal gasification process would become economicagain. \"It\'s too expensive for the time being,\" Semenovichsaid. \"Theoretical development is underway and tests are beingrun.

Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich, the head of petroleumgeology at Moscow State University, told delegates at the WorldPetroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also beimproved through new and more sophisticated technology. \"We should emphasize that when having the data aboutpetroleum distribution onshore and offshore, it is possible toclarify the idea of global regularities in oil and gasprospects,\" Semenovich said. \"However, much work should be doneto coordinate data concerning the structure and oil and gasprospects in adjoining onshore and offshore basins.\" Sharing the information could help geologists betterpredict regional trends and underground formations thatindicate the presence of oil or gas, he said. Semenovich also said that existing estimates of thepotential oil and natural gas resources of the world may needto be revised upward as oil companies continue to examineunexplored regions. The world, which has already produced 476 billion barrelsof oil and gas, has a current total of about 733 billionbarrels in proved reserves. Undiscovered resources areestimated at about 1.4 trillion barrels, or about half of thetotal ultimate reserves, Semenovich said. \"There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the worldand, as far as the already known basins, one continues to findadditional reserves,\" he said, noting that Antarctica has beenvirtually ignored. \"The existing estimate of potentialresources of the world may need to be enlarged.\" To find deeper and more expensive reserves, scientists willneed to use 3-D mapping of underground formations and laserspectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among othertechniques, he said. He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13pct of all offshore reserves. Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oiland gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would bediscovered and placed in production during the next 50 years. After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oilproduction was increasing. \"The difficulties of 1985 have beenovercome and we\'re now back to normal production,\" he said. The Soviet Union, the world\'s largest producer of oil, hadexperienced drilling and technical problems that cut totalliquids production from 12.45 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 12.1mln barrels a day in 1985. Last year, the Soviets produced anestimated 12.3 mln barrels. When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coalgasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich saidthe project was important because of the lack of oil reservesin the region. Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oilprices the coal gasification process would become economicagain. \"It\'s too expensive for the time being,\" Semenovichsaid. \"Theoretical development is underway and tests are beingrun. For the moment, coal gasification is a very small part ofthe energy industry,\" he said. Reuter',1 NAT-GAS}

{0 'Civil strife in Sri Lanka willmake the economy\'s growth rate in 1987 its slowest in a decade,Sri Lankan finance minister Ronnie de Mel said here. He told Reuters in an interview that he expected grossdomestic product to expand by only four pct in 1987. He said itaveraged five pct over the past three years. For the first two years after the present troubles began in1983, production of key commodities like tea, rubber, coconutsand rice kept up, he said. Tamils on the island are fighting for a seperate state. De Mel said: \"Private sector production in fact grew by 25pct in 1984 and 20 pct in 1985. But last year things took aturn for the worse.\" He said prices of tea, the main export, fell to half their1984 levels. World prices of rubber and copra also fell. \"There was also a decline in income from tourism andremittances from Sri Lankans working in the Middle East.\" He said any savings from the worldwide drop in crude oilprices were wiped out by the cut in commodity earnings. \"To add to all this we have had, between January and Marchthis year, the worst drought I have seen in my life,\" he said. De Mel said the drought would seriously affect agriculturalproduction. He said because of the fighting in the country, defenceexpenditure was now about 20 pct of the national 1987 budget of70 billion rupees. Sri Lanka planned to borrow about 600 mln dlrs in 1987 fromthe World Bank and the Sri Lanka Aid Consortium which comprisesmembers of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD), he said. \"We also plan to ask the International Monetary Fund foranother 200 mln dlrs through a structural adjustment facilityand a compensatory financing facility to balance our exportrevenue cuts,\" de Mel said. He said despite the unrest, Sri Lanka had succeeded inkeeping its total foreign debt to three billion dlrs byavoiding borrowing from commercial banks. \"Commercial bank debt accounts for only 15 pct of our totalforeign debt,\" he said. He said the Mahaweli hydro-electric project was nearingcompletion. It was likely to cut dependence on oil imports. \"The project will more than treble our hydro-electric powerfrom 300 megawatts to nearly 1,000 megawatts,\" de Mel said. He said 20 new townships would rise around the project,which is in the north-central part of the island. It wasexpected to irrigate 1.2 mln acres of land and indirectlyprovide employment for 500,000 landless families.

{0 'Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reserves haverisen to a new high of 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, and officialsattribute the increase to a surging trade surplus and theinflux of speculative funds. The reserves, up from 54 billion dlrs on April 19, comparewith 27.3 billion a year ago, the Central Bank said. Vice economic minister Wang Chien-shien told Reuters: \"Therising reserves will certainly intensify our trade frictionwith the U.S.\" A central bank official, who declined to be named, saidTaiwan\'s trade surplus is expected to exceed 5.5 billion U.S.Dlrs in the first four months of 1987, against 4.25 billion ayear ago. The influx of speculative funds, mainly from Hong Kong,Japan and the U.S., Also played a major role behind the rise ofthe reserves, he said, but declined to give figures. Banking sources said almost 10 billion U.S. Dlrs hadentered Taiwan since early 1986. About three billion of thefunds were remitted through different channels, including theblack market, since the start of this year, they said. Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government\'s Councilfor Economic Planning and Development, said he expects thereserves to rise in the next few months because of thecontinuing high level of Taiwan\'s exports and the steadyappreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency. \"The latest government moves to open (the domestic) market,cut import tariffs and lift foreign exchange controls haveachieved little success,\" he said. Vice economic minister Li Mo said tariffs were cut on some1,700 products in January and a further 862 this month in a bidto encourage more imports, especially the U.S. More tariff cuts on about 300 imported products, includingtelevisions, video tape recorders, cosmetics and refrigeratorswill be announced in a month or two, Li said. Li\'s colleague, Wang Chien-shien, said the government willsend several trade missions to the U.S. This year to buy aboutone billion U.S. Dlrs of products, including machinery, powerequipment, grains and precision tools. \"We earnestly hope to reduce our trade surplus with theU.S.,\" he said. Taiwan\'s trade surplus rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S.Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, and it widened to3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 against 2.78 billiona year ago, official statistics show.

Central bank spokesman Siri Karncharoendi told reportersthe Thai economy clearly recovered in the first quarter fromthe lingering effects of the 1984-85 recession. He said the industrial sector is expected to expand 5.5 pctthis year, up from five pct in 1986. Agricultural output isprojected to grow 2.8 pct after 1.5 pct contraction in 1986. He said January/March imports grew 19.2 pct to 70.7 billionbaht, in response to an improving domestic market, comparedwith a nine pct decline to 59.3 billion a year ago. Non-oilimports grew 24.8 pct to 60.2 billion baht while oil importsdeclined 5.6 pct to 10.5 billion. First quarter exports increased 12.7 pct to 63.2 billionbaht compared with 14.4 pct and 56.1 billion a year ago. Siri said he expects the trade deficit to widen to about 30billion baht this year from 17.4 billion in 1986. The currentaccount, which last year posted a surplus of 3.5 billion baht,is projected to return to a 7.4 billion deficit in 1987. He said overall January/March lending by the Thai bankingsystem grew a strong nine pct to 577.9 billion baht, up from4.7 pct growth in the previous quarter and 5.8 pct for thewhole of 1986.

{0 'European Community (EC) agricultureministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeplydivided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of theEC\'s farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns. Their chairman, Belgium\'s Paul de Keersmaeker, told a newsconference after the meeting he would work on a paper settingout possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks, withthe hope that the ministers can get down to detailednegotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18. But diplomats said the talks this week had served littlemore than to clarify member states\' positions on the complexpackage of measures proposed by the commission. The executive body has proposed measures which would resultin price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct. Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced andimported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion Europeancurrency units, to help the EC\'s cash crisis, and changes inthe conversion of EC common farm prices into nationalcurrencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German andDutch farmers. De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differencesbetween EC states on the oils tax proposal, the currencymeasures and the key question of cereals prices and associatedmeasures. But he told journalists, \"We have used this meeting to reachthe point at which real negotiations can start at the nextmeeting.

He said he would review the position as part of plans topresent compromise proposals for the 1987/88 farm price packageto the next meeting, starting in Brussels on May 18. De Keersmaeker, who said there was \"a great deal ofresistance in many delegations\" to the tax, declined to say whataspects of the proposals he would review. However, EC Commission sources said they are expected toinclude the question of whether it should apply to marine oils. They said Denmark and Portugal might agree to the tax, tobe set initially at 330 Ecus a tonne, if these oils, of whichthey are major producers, were excluded. The sources said, however, that Britain, the Netherlandsand West Germany continue to have strong objections to the tax,partly because of fears that its impact on U.S. Soybean exportscould provoke transatlantic trade friction. They said that, if these three countries held firm to thisposition, they would be able to block the proposal under theEC\'s majority voting mechanism. Reuter',1 VEG-OIL}

{0 'Speculation abroad that theBundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening thefor interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by manyeconomists and money market dealers within Germany. Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank wouldengineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark. A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, promptingspeculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate,has raised the question whether Germany and Japan would alsobroaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar. The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interestrate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said. Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could takepressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said. Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if thetrade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said. But if no solution is found, the Paris dealers said, arenewed dollar fall would put strains on the mark/French francrate and force the Bank of France to raise short-term rates. The three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate rose to six pctthis week from 5.6 pct at the start of April, and the yield onthe 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in Tokyo toa 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late March. The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discountrate speculation. But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which wouldput pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterdaythe U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates. The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said,adding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan\'s 2.5 pctdiscount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor SatoshiSumita said was not under consideration. A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch centralbank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bankfavoured a cut in West German interest rates and would followsuit if it happened. Citibank AG said in its April report that another expectedphase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut keymoney market rates in the next three to six months. The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct onrepurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around3.70 pct for much of April. Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reidsaid the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further,either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interestrate, allowing the market to set the rate. \"I\'m fairly confident we\'ll see lower rates,\" he said. Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase ratewould have little impact on the German economy or fundamentalexchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions. \"A cut in German rates wouldn\'t be bad for the dollar, but Ithink its effect would be limited in duration unless it wasaccompanied by other measures elsewhere,\" he said. Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad thatthe Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said theBundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at themoment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month. The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to aninterest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. Thatshould not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,they said. The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interestrate tenders, following the introduction of a new system tospeed up the tender process at the start of April, they said. Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at theDIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said theBundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts. \"I don\'t think that if they cut the repurchase rate a littleit would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,\" he said. But asharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force theBundesbank to take some action, he said. Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut ininterest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth. Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that themonetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows ratherthan credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate responseto excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to makethe mark and mark investments less attractive. Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investorswould switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, whichhave swollen central bank money stock, into securities, whichwould take them out of the Bundesbank\'s key monetary measure. A cut in interest rates at this stage however would leadinvestors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the nextmove would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buyingbonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen. There are so far no signs that German investors areswitching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbankhopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bankeconomist Hermann Remsperger said. But Phillips and Drew\'s Reid said prospects of lower ratesand a strong currency would attract foreign investors intoGerman bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors. Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerlandin Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates wouldcontinue to drift lower in many European countries. \"The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britainbut more limited in West Germany, where we could see someconsolidation,\" he said. Switzerland could be forced to matchany cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising furtheragainst the mark, he said. Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut inU.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as thepound had shrugged off yesterday\'s cuts and was still rising. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discountrate speculation. But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which wouldput pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterdaythe U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates. The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said,adding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan\'s 2.5 pctdiscount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor SatoshiSumita said was not under consideration. A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch centralbank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bankfavoured a cut in West German interest rates and would followsuit if it happened. Citibank AG said in its April report that another expectedphase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut keymoney market rates in the next three to six months. The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct onrepurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around3.70 pct for much of April. Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reidsaid the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further,either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interestrate, allowing the market to set the rate. \"I\'m fairly confident we\'ll see lower rates,\" he said. Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase ratewould have little impact on the German economy or fundamentalexchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions. \"A cut in German rates wouldn\'t be bad for the dollar, but Ithink its effect would be limited in duration unless it wasaccompanied by other measures elsewhere,\" he said. Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad thatthe Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said theBundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at themoment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month. The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to aninterest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. Thatshould not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,they said. The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interestrate tenders, following the introduction of a new system tospeed up the tender process at the start of April, they said. Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at theDIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said theBundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts. \"I don\'t think that if they cut the repurchase rate a littleit would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,\" he said. But asharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force theBundesbank to take some action, he said. Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut ininterest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth. Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that themonetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows ratherthan credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate responseto excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to makethe mark and mark investments less attractive. Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investorswould switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, whichhave swollen central bank money stock, into securities, whichwould take them out of the Bundesbank\'s key monetary measure. A cut in interest rates at this stage however would leadinvestors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the nextmove would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buyingbonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen. There are so far no signs that German investors areswitching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbankhopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bankeconomist Hermann Remsperger said. But Phillips and Drew\'s Reid said prospects of lower ratesand a strong currency would attract foreign investors intoGerman bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors. Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerlandin Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates wouldcontinue to drift lower in many European countries. \"The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britainbut more limited in West Germany, where we could see someconsolidation,\" he said. Switzerland could be forced to matchany cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising furtheragainst the mark, he said.

{0 'Speculation abroad that theBundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening thefor interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by manyeconomists and money market dealers within Germany. Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank wouldengineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark. A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, promptingspeculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate,has raised the question whether Germany and Japan would alsobroaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar. The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interestrate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said. Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could takepressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said. Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if thetrade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said.

{0 'The oil price collapse of 1986 putdevelopment of a vast petroleum resource -- heavy and extraheavy oils -- on hold. But as oil prices increase the long-termeconomic outlook is favorable, oil industry experts said. \"Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oilsexceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are locatedin Venezuela,\" Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos deVenezuela told the World Petroleum Congress. \"And this virtually unused resource represents a primeexample of the need to invest in technology to ensuretomorrow\'s energy future,\" he added. Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor oflight oils because of economics and a very limited market. Notmany refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils. \"Improved technology has the potential for reducing thecapital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oildevelopment projects by 30 pct or more,\" Gordon Willmon, VP andgeneral manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso ResourcesCanada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress. Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel lastsummer as OPEC members increased production to gain marketshare, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the OPECproduction/pricing agreement is basically in tact. Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25pct of remaining petroleum resources. \"So future demand increasingly will be met from the variousforms of heavy oil,\" Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resourcesinclude extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands andoil shales (in sedimentary rock). Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oildevelopment economical, including real and stable growth incrude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improvedtechnology. He said he expects \"all pieces of the puzzle to fittogether.\" But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is verysensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most importantfactor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of theprice of crude. Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eightdlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive foran oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil. He said the current price differential is only about fivedlrs a barrel. Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20dlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are abroad range of high potential cost-effective technologies forresources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils,which would permit commercial development despite a lower crudeoil price outlook. Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recoveryby steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce theviscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through apipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reducecurrent captial investment and operating costs. But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may notencourage new investment, that oil prices need to show ameaningful and sustained recovery. Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils productionis fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, ratherthan in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VPOperations <Syncrude Canada Ltd>. While exploration costs for conventional crude oil rangefrom four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for syntheticcrude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location andnature of the deposit are known, according to Smith. But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean thateverything required to build and operate the plant must comefrom outside the area. Willmon also said, \"Public policy could best help byproviding financial support to offset the high cost oftechnology developmemt which would help generate projects thatcould survive even at low oil prices for extended periods oftime.\" U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, \"The ReaganAdministration is firmly committed, without equivocation, tocontinuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives inthe marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration anddevelopment.\" Reuter',1 CRUDE}

{0 'A bill that would impose an oilimport fee to support a world floor price for oil of 25 dlrs abarrel was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by12 Congressmen from oil-producing states. The variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices riseabove 25 dlrs a barrel, sponsors of the bill said. Revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oilfrom stripper wells - those that produce 10 barrels a day orless - at a fixed price of 25 dlrs a barrel. Purchases wouldstop when prices rose above that level. \"Time is running out on the domestic oil and gas industry,\"Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said in a statement. \"An oil importfee is really just the premium for a national insurancepolicy.\" President Reagan opposes an oil import fee, but supportersof the bill said they hoped for action on it before the end ofthe year.

{0 'Better times for the hard hitnatural gas industry remains two to three years away as aseemingly intractable supply bubble continues to depress salesand prices, industry officials said. An uncertain regulatory environment, disputes over Canadianpricing policies and unusually warm winters are working againsta quick recovery in the sector, a number of corporate andgovernment speakers told an energy conference here. \"We see a tough, tough short-term market, both as to priceand volume,\" said Michael Phelps, vice president of <WestcoastTransmission Co Ltd>, a major Canadian natural gas carrier. But Phelps predicted a fall in U.S. supply -- caused by asharp drop in exploration -- and a slight demand increaseshould help to burn off the excess supply by 1990. As a result, Canadian gas exports to the U.S. market shouldrise to up to 1.5 trillion cubic feet a year by the end of thedecade, nearly double 1986\'s total. The health of the Canadian industry is heavily dependent onthe U.S. market where nearly one third of Canada\'s gasproduction is sent. Cuba Wadlington, a vice president at Northwest PipelineCorp of Salt Lake City, shared the view that markets could bein balance by 1990. He said while North American demand for natural gas hasflattened at about 18 trillion cubic feet a year, a return tomore colder winters in the next few years could quickly tightensupplies. \"Things are clearly working towards a shrinking of thebubble,\" Wadlington told Reuters in an interview. However, recent decisions by the U.S. Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission (FERC) were sharply criticized byCanadian delegates who suggested the moves could prevent thecountry from participating in the market\'s recovery. The key dispute, known as the as billed issue, involves aruling last December by FERC which effectively bars U.S.pipeline companies and consumers from paying certain Canadianshipping expenses. The Canadian government believes the ruling could severelyweaken the country\'s gas producers. \"Besides theextra-territorial effect, there is the potential that Conadianproducers and consumers may end up subsidizing the cost oftransportation services originally incurred on behalf of U.S.customers,\" said Robert Skinner, an assistant deputy minister inCanada\'s energy department. But FERC Chairman Martha Hesse told the conference theruling was really intended \"to assure equal, fair and opencompetition in the pricing of natural gas sold within ourcountry -- whatever the source of the gas.\" Hesse maintained Canadian gas was crucial to the emergenceof a freely competitive, continent-wide, energy market. Speaking to concerns in Canada that the U.S. is seeking tolimit Canadian gas shipments, Hesse said such a move would workagainst the long-term interest of American consumers. \"We trulyconstitute a North American market,\" she said. \"Natural gasmoving through pipelines recognizes no boundries.\" Reuter',1 NAT-GAS}

{0 'Demand for natural gas has failed togrow in proportion to the decline in oil deliveries because ofconcerns over unresolved regulatory issues in the UnitedStates, said industry analysts and gas utility company sources. \"Natural gas is not free to compete,\" said Larry Makovich,director of utilities service at Data Resources Inc, \"problemson pipeline open access and take-or-pay liabilities still weighheavily on end-users\' decision to switch to natural gas.\" A manager with an East Coast gas distribution company,agreed that reluctance among end-users often stemmed from fearof unresolved regulatory issues. \"The fact that at the federal level open access is not yetfirmly in place threatens to impede free flow of natural gasfrom producers to consumers,\" he said. Michael German, an economist with the American GasAssociation, said while a significant amount of gas was nowreplacing oil in dual-fuel boilers, the progress of expandingthe marketshare of gas was slow. First quarter natural gasconsumption data is not available until June. In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demandfell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to theAmerican Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was notable to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption. AGA\'s German said that while industrial consumers wereconcerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capitalinvestment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied onspot purchases. \"With all the capability of switching (from oil to naturalgas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern,\" hesaid, adding that compared with the same period last year,January natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower forindustrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities. German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gasto lower demand in the utility sector as a whole. \"March was warmer than normal, which cut down gasconsumption not only in home heating but also in electricitygeneration,\" he said. In March, according to API monthly statistics, residualfuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per dayfrom the same period a year ago. While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas priceshad put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electricutilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed therole of natural gas was over-stated. Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in thefuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on streamin the last few years. Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projectedthe same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988. In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pctof the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989,he said. Within this sector, gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986from 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oilprices, he added. But this year, gas was expected to recaptureonly two pct of the share, Makovich said. Michael German of AGA agreed and said, \"Nevertheless,outlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year issignificant in a glutted market.\" Reuter',1 NAT-GAS}

The first joint well drilled is inthe Gulf of Mexico\'s Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater leasethat Conoco was almost forced to return to the federalgovernment undrilled because of low oil prices. \"At this moment we have no success but we will proceed withConoco. Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there,\"Kasahara said. He said that similar kinds of joint ventures\"would be best\" for Nippon Mining\'s oil exploration efforts inthe future. Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning toacquire any U.S. refining or marketing outlets. \"Retail salesin general do not interest the Japanese oil companies,\" hesaid. When asked whether he believed world oil prices mightstrengthen later this year, Kasahara said he expected prices tohold steady at today\'s level. \"Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel willcontinue. But next year I don\'t know,\" he said. \"For therefining business, stability is important. Whether the price is18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don\'t care.\" But encouraging additional upstream efforts may requiremodestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. \"For exploration Ithink 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would bereasonable,\" he said. The key factor in determining whether the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr abarrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran andIraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertainelement in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintainrevenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reducedoil profits. Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers isbenefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favorscontinuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currencyregardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said. \"I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continueto improve.

One Mexican mining sector official working closely with thegovernment\'s production and sales policy told Reuters therehave been no changes in policy handed down by the central bank. \"The same policy that has been followed will be continued,\"said the official, who asked not to be further identified. A spokesman for the central bank said the bank had noinformation on any silver policy changes. An energy and mines ministry spokesman and an official inthe ministry\'s metallurgy department also said no governmentsilver policy change had been made. The mining sector official also said he doubted Mexicowould follow Peru\'s policy, reasoning that if the twogovernments had intended to coordinate silver policies, Mexicowould have announced a sales suspension along with Peru lastweek. \"It\'s very probable a change won\'t be made,\" the officialsaid.

{0 'China\'s oil drilling industry is one ofthe few bright spots in the international oilpatch with about1,000 rigs currently working and annual increases of 80-100expected through the end of the century, a Chinese petroleumofficial said. \"In China, production concentrates on the domestic market,and does not depend on the international price of oil,\" ZhaiGuang Ming, a director of the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum,told Reuters. Chinese oil sold within the nation\'s borders is priced atabout one-third the 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price establishedby the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Zhai saidin an interview at the World Petroleum Congress. The optimism in China is in sharp contrast to the UnitedStates where weak oil prices have prompted a steep fall in thenumber of active rigs from a 1981 peak of 4,500 to only 765last week according to the latest Baker Hughes Co rig count. At this time, China actually has more rigs in operationthan any other country in the world, said Xianglin Hou, anothermember of the 20-man Chinese delegation at the Houston meeting. But this does not mean good news for the sagging oilfieldequipment industry in the rest of the world, said Bryan Walman,international sales manager for Reed Tool Co in Houston. Walman said more than 90 pct of China\'s drilling activityis on land and under the control of the Chinese governmentwhich requires local manufacture of drilling equipment. But U.S. and other western nations do provide equipment forChina\'s fledgling offshore projects as well as participate inthe actual drilling, he said. Amoco Corp <AN>, for example, has reported a discovery in1,000 feet of water in the South China Sea. \"We\'re encouraged,\" said Alfred Munk, manager of Amoco\'sforeign affairs, \"but we need substantial reserves before wecan do commercial production in a remote area like that.\" Zhai estimated that current Chinese oil production of 130mln tonnes a year should rise to total 200 mln tonnes annuallyby the year 2,000.

{0 'An oil import fee could costconsumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-termU.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said. The study by the FTC\'s bureau of economics found that afive dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil importswould increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs ayear. After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against thecosts, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee wouldhave a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year. Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cutthe federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energyconservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil. But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs wouldreduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domesticoil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found. \"Any attempt to increase our energy security by limitingimports will actually reduce our long-run energy security byspeeding the depletion of domestic reserves,\" the study said. The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domesticpetroleum refiners\' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year,increase domestic crude oil producers\' profits by about 13billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said. Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistentlyopposed government regulation of the oil industry at the stateand federal levels. \"This study backs up my belief that government regulationand interference with competition hurt both the market andconsumers,\" FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement.

{0 'The depressed offshore oil industry isstill waiting for a turnaround despite increasing optimisimthat world oil prices have stabilized around 18 dlrs a barrel. \"The perception of a turnaround comes from the change inprices,\" Charles Siess Jr, vice chairman of MarathonManufacturing Co, a subsidiary of USX Corp <X>, and chairman ofthe National Ocean Industries Association, said in a pressbriefing at the Offshore Technology Conference. \"From the level of industry activity, there is noturnaround,\" he added. John Huff, president of Oceaneering International Inc<OCER>, was slightly more optimistic. \"We are through the lowpart of the cycle -- there\'s an increase in interest forprojects,\" he said, adding, \"whether it comes to orders, whoknows?\" The oil industry is recovering from last year\'s dramaticfall in oil prices, from 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to under10 dlrs in mid-1986. Particularly hard hit were the servicecompanies that provide the oil rigs with keys products, such aspipe and tools. Earlier in the week, Secretary the Interior Donald Hodelannounced -- at the Conference -- the government\'s newfive-year offshore oil and gas leasing program, proposing 38sales, including tracts in the Gulf Coast, offshore Californiaand in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. For the most part, the industry was disappointed with theplan, with most arguing that additional areas should have beenincluded. At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel. Environmental concerns, particularly in California, hadlobbied strenuously against offshore oil development. \"The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails totake into account the environmental performance of the oilindustry,\" said Bill Bradford, executive vice president ofDresser Industries <DI> and president of the PetroleumEquipment Suppliers Association. Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showingoffshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollutionin the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct andmuniciple dumping 31 pct. \"The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reservedevelopment program,\" said Siess, adding that with oil importsrising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one ofnational security. Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president ofDupont\'s <DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, \"We are more likelyto see a five pct increase in spending this year than thewidely-forecast five pct decrease.\" Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in NewOrleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln. However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading andBates Drilling Co <RB>, said the oversupply of rigs wouldcontinue for the near-term, but added demand fortechnologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s. Much of that demand is seen coming from the move intoicreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever moreexpensive and needing five to ten years to develop. Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deepwater tracts. Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, asubsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>, and president of theMarine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drillexploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water. Geer said the industry was particularly interested in theGreen Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number ofcompanies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp\'s Marathon Oil Co,Standard Oil Co <SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many ofthem testing new deep-water technologies involving floatingplatforms.

They will be announced to the nation by Lusinchiin a televised address tonight but the text of the decrees wasreleased this afternoon. Businessmen, who met Lusinchi, opposed the pay rise, sayingit will fuel inflation. The inflation rate was 11.5 pct in 1986and private economists say it will be 25 to 30 pct in 1987. The central bank said first quarter inflation was 6.3 pct. The wage increase for public and private sector employeeswill be 30 pct on salaries of up to 2,100 bolivars a month. Forsalaries of from 2,101 to 6,100 bolivars 25 pct and for thoseof 6,101 to 20,000 bolivars 20 pct. The measures were taken in response to a request from theVenezuelan confederation CTV for an increase to offset the lossin the purchasing power of workers\' salaries. It estimated theloss at 40 pct. The general wage rise is the third granted by Lusinchisince his government took office in February 1984. The wage increases are a bonus and will not be consideredin calculating benefits or severance pay, the decree said. At the same time, Lusinchi declared a freeze on lay-offsand firings for the next 120 days. The price freeze applies to a group of 120 foods and otherconsumer goods declared to be \"of primary necessity.\" It does not apply to prices charged by agriculturalproducers or to goods for which the price is falling.

The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,take effect on July 1. This brings to 157 the number of goods on which importtaxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said. The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington hasasked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added. Today\'s announcement follows Saturday\'s removal of importcurbs on 170 products. For 46 of those products, the U.S. Hadhad sought free access to the South Korean market. \"This is in line with the government\'s policy to limit ourtrade surplus with the United States to help reduce tradefriction between the two countries,\" the official said. South Korea\'s trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.3billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion in 1985. Officials saidthe surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but Seoulwould try to hold it below eight billion dlrs. The finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later thismonth on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn andethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to checkinflation.

{0 'The use of tariffs and quotas toreduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will dolittle to cut the nation\'s swelling trade deficit, a governmentstudy said. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products lesscompetitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost ofimported products that are re-exported in different forms. \"Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather thanhelp, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,\" it said. The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilkeand Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, whichclimbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shiftingcurrency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand. Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such asforeign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrialcompetitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictionson mergers, added little to the problem, it said. \"Although each industry\'s competitiveness affects the levelof imports and exports in that industry, in general we findthat there have been no significant industry-specific changesaffecting competitiveness that would explain the increase inthe overall trade deficit,\" the study said. \"To the extent any government action is needed to deal withthe trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-widephenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,\"the FTC study said. Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shiftswere the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the reportsaid it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost somedomestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s. It also said it found a \"fairly direct relationship\" betweenthe increased trade deficit and the influence of shiftingcurrency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domesticdemand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreignconsumer demand. The study examined seven factors which have been commonlyblamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies andtrade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack ofinvestment in U.S. Industry, declining research and developmentin U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oilprices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations. In each case, the study found little or no evidence thatthe factor had any impact on the trade deficit. REUTER',1 TRADE}

He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position. Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble. Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical. He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground. Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research. Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs. Romero said he would also visit Oxford University\'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether. \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root.\" He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop. \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I\'m not comfortable with that,\" hesaid.

Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.

With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said. \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\"he said. Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents. Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests. He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output. \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said. Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said. \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That\'s a lot of space,\" Romerosaid. He said the government\'s proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land. \"If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won\'t happen,\" he said. PCA figures show about one-third of the country\'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry. Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land.

{0 'Crude oil prices could remain around 18dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC\'s decision onoutput at its next meeting would be the critical factor, anofficial of Mexico\'s state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen. Adrian Lajous, Pemex\' executive vice president ofinternational trade, said current OPEC output already appearedto be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itselffor the third quarter. \"Production is surging ahead of what wasoriginally planned, while demand is growing more slowly thanenvisaged a few months ago,\" he said. He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level ofproduction in the third quarter would effectively sustain the18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally beenenvisaged might soften price levels. The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 inVienna to review its December accord on prices and output. \"I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude interms of volume decisions,\" Lajous said. A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boostedoutput and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, isalways there as a possibility, he said. \"I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. Iexpect other oil exporters have learned their lessons anddiscipline will be maintained,\" he said. Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long asthis remains there will be a tendency to instability in oilmarkets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during1987 if output remains under control. He said Saudi King Fahd\'s remarks last month, thatincreased production was not so important as long as incomeswould not be affected by the output, were \"very relevant andwelcome from such a powerful producer.\" REUTER',1 CRUDE}

The agreement signed in January for the months fromFebruary to June is up for renegotiation. Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mlnbpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp<XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc <TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp<MOB> and Chevron Corp <CHV> 550,000 bpd between them. But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarterallowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift itsobligations under the contract PIW said that that one alternative under consideration isto revert to four individual contracts rather than a collectiveagrement. John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more ofa formality as the Saudis have each company on a separateschedule although separate agreements with the companies wouldfavor one on one negotiations and ensure that contractedliftings occur . \"The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants withinlimits as they do not want to antagonize them for the longhaul,\" he said. Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likelyconcentrate on volume rather than price. Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been notedand in April industry publications said that renegotiation werebeing sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.

{0 'A cut of about half a percentage pointin Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, althougheconomists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves. Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and widepremiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first. Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advancesrate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped itsrepurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct. That rate has remained in force, just holding above thefive pct official secured loans rate which governs commercialbank borrowings. Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West Germanrepo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said. In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate tothree pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered moneymarket rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loansrate on lending under its three month credit quota. Since then, however, both the Central Bank and FinanceMinistry have made it clear they favour lower official rates. In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said hewould follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the FinanceMinistry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billionguilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pctfor an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965. Technically, analysts said, there has to be a differencebetween the secured loans rate which applies to lending underthe credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which addextra liquidity to the money market. Bank economists and dealers said a West German move tofurther lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts wouldresult in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted. The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around itsparity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673guilders per 100 marks. Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a levelthat would not permit a change in the interest ratedifferential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealerssaid. An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German andDutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, hesaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflationexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest ratesin the longer term. In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,or even negative, while the latest official economic forecastspoint to a falling rate of economic growth. \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreementnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"the ABN economist said. He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct inJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation. At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run totwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in thesecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.

EC industry ministers meeting here considered two keyproposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mlntonnes by 1990. The first would limit the current quota system, which hasprotected EC output for seven years, only to flat products andheavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel productsinto free market competition. The second proposal would link continuation of a quotasystem with progress toward plant closures, although less thana month ago the EC steelmakers\' lobby group Eurofer said theyhad abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily. The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solutionimmediately, instead urging steel producers to try again toreach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.

{0 'Computer Associates International Inc\'s800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp <UCE> will eliminate itsstrongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competitionfrom International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Wall Streetanalysts said. \"IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systemssoftware,\" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkinand Jenrette. \"But the combination of the two companies will clearlypresent a much stronger front,\" he said. Besides IBM, \"Computer Associates will be far and away themost powerful company in the field,\" added E.F. Hutton analystTerence Quinn. That field is a segment of the market known as systemutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity ofa company\'s data processing facilities by increasing the speed,power and efficiency of large mainframe computers. The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines thetwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms thatwill find the competition much harder than in the past. For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps asix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry. When the deal is completed sometime in August, thecompany\'s revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp <MFST> as the world\'s largest independentsoftware vendor. Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wangtook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3mln dlrs for the year ended March 31. Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computerbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframecomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp. Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after themerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth. On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of sixcompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs. For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, onsales of 141.5 mln dlrs. The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largelybecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from thedark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or56 cts a share. At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 differentbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computersoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from hisjob as chairman of General Electric Co\'s <GE> computer servicesunit. Computer Associates\' Wang and Uccel\'s Liemandt said at anews conference that the merger would give computer users asingle source for a wide range of software products. In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates alsosell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroadsin the applications software market, where analysts said it hasbeen successful with accounting and banking systems. Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support andenhance both companies\' product lines, but noted that thecompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He saidabout 20 pct of the companies\' products overlap. Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings ofcurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. Butthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not diluteComputer Associates\' earnings for the current fiscal year. Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record ofcompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05dlrs a share. Wang said he would look closely at the combined operationsof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketingand research and development. Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.Based on Friday\'s closing price, the company will swap 47.50dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly33 times Uccel\'s 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share. Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said mostsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 timesper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth thepremium because of its earnings potential and customer base. Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currentlyowns 58 pct of Uccel. The executive said the merger would not alter his target ofmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct. In addition, he said he expects no problems in having thedeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. JusticeDepartment. Uccel\'s Liemandt declined to say what he will do after themerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang. Reuter',1 ACQ}

{0 'Traders recently returned from West Africasay some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective actionso far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) bufferstock manager on buffer stock purchases. One trader said some West African producers are annoyed theBuffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by theInternational Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have beentaken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first weekhe bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of thelimitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa sayproducers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices sofar, noting producing countries are part of the internationalcocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have togain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day averageindicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or referenceprice). However, little progress has been made in that direction,and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lowerintervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will bemaking purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of theagreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock managerare not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sourcesthere saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with theintermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against totalpotential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.Carryover holdings from the previous International CocoaAgreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne fromFriday\'s close, basis July at its high of 1,271.

{0 'European free market tin traders made asomewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpurdollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October. Traders said the new market would probably be a usefultrading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tininterests although European traders generally appear to bereasonably satisfied with the current \"free market\" systemwhich has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tintrading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want tosee how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market andwhat sort of demand develops for forward deliveries. There is also a view among European traders that, while theproposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide anotheruseful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysiangovernment -- in the past viewed as a major player at times bythe trade -- would make participants uncomfortable. Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption oftrading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that whilethere has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subjecta definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Courtlitigation actions have been resolved. Spot tin prices on the European free market are currentlyaround 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouseRotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a tenyear low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as4,680 stg in December 1986. This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME tradingceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year. LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485tonnes reached in February 1986. Traders said the free market turned bullish during latelast year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demanddeficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predictingprices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987. However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswingin sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December. The decline accelerated as producers who had sold verylittle metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers. There was also a lack of significant demand from majorsteel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year. Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks\' original tinholdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,and the bulk of material still available is being held byMalaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress themarket with unwanted metal. Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after theInternational Tin Council\'s, ITC, buffer stock manager haltedsupport operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 membersnations of the International Tin Agreement. The overhang of metal was reduced further by brokerShearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reportedhaving sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tinposition. Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tinprices and movements are still expected to be largely relatedto currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demandemerges for the third quarter. The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has madeefforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher worldprices by attempting to bring all major producers under anexport control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, twomajor producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument andapparently are continuing to offer material at discounts toconsumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

Officials of PayN\' Pak did were not immediately available for comment. Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised byShearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and \"wemay add a bank to that.\" \"We\'ve submitted an agreement we\'re prepared to sign,\" hesaid.

The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude andone-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region. Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service isrestored by Friday there would be little problem in restoringoil which has been lost to the flood. \"But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will bedifficult to make up without prorationing and we would not liketo proration this pipeline, if we don\'t have to.\" The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic RichfieldCorp <ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/ShellGroup <RD> and Texaco Inc <TX>, which is the pipeline\'soperator.

He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged wasunderground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoilnearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil wasapparently washed away. The potential for environmental damage is being downplayedat this time despite the volume of oil that runs through thisline.

Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcementthat same day of higher earnings expectations changed itsvalue. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceedanalysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share. At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in thelow 40s, Augenthaler said.

The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc <em>for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder EddieAntar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canadaannounced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private. Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues andprofits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into thehighly competitive New York City retail market for consumerelectronics, the nation\'s biggest, at a time the fortunes ofelectronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based EntertainmentMarketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whosepresent buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, hadthe management expertise for retailing or was merely trying todrive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. \"I have mixed feelings,\" said analyst Dennis Telzrow ofEppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. \"On the one handit\'s probably a cheap price. On the other hand, doesEntertainment Marketing have the management talent to run itand will the Crazy Eddie people leave?\" \"It\'s a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,\" saidanalyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, aMinneapolis brokerage. \"Electronics retailing is very managementconcentrated; they\'d want to keep Crazy Eddie\'s management inplace.\" Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing alreadyowns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie\'s 31.3 million shares, it maybe trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its7-dlr-a-share offer. Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid wasannounced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a sharein over-the- counter trading. Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New YorkCity, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month thathis group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie\'s shares. A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company\'s board has takenno decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrssince they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. Hewould not comment on the new offer. Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such asdisk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods toretailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly toconsumers by cable television.

Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PCretailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought byan investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York. Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management andventure capital firm, would disclose the value of thetransaction.

{0 'U.S. District Court Judge EugeneA. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow onBurlington Industries Inc\'s request for an injunction to stopSamjens Acquisition Corp\'s takeover bid for the company. Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case couldbe pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeoverbattle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker. Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyersfor Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by DominionTextile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman. Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminaryinjunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer untilthe case is decided. Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlrbuyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per sharelower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjenslast week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjensoffer. Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman andDominion used illegally obtained confidential information aboutthe company in making their takeover attempt. That information, Burlington said, was provided by JamesAmmeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebberGroup Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington\'ssales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never todivulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he beganworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to\"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace itsmanagement,\" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information fromPaineWebber, but argued the information was public informationand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts orBurlington\'s public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met withEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet withthem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion wentpublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.Burlington lawyers claim Dominion\'s board decided to attempt atakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board inFebruary. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion helddiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting asfinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke offbecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman anddominion with a written statement that they did not provideinside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeenwithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairmanFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive andthreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in aneffort to takeover Burlilgnton. \"The ultimate question is not the price per share or theprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct forthose who would takeover an American company,\" said burlingtonlawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as thelargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be inviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada\'slargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plantsin Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,the lawyers said. Samjens\' lawyers discounted the concern. They said themarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contendsand that Burlington has the ability to switch between lightweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and pricedictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed byBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bidfor Dominion. \"Surely, what would have been sauce for the goosewould have been sauce for the gander,\" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,a Samjens lawyer.

{0 'The dollar\'s recent signs of stabilityhave raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves untilafter the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April. \"The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if thedollar has bottomed out,\" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp. Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its valueagainst the yen and the mark as part of an officiallyorchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive onworld markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances. On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yenbut has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months. Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen farenough to ease the trade deficit\'s drag on the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in Marchfrom 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continuedimprovement in April in volume, if not in real, terms. Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that iffurther progress is reported, the dollar would head back uptowards 150 yen. \"There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomedout for the medium term,\" added Tom Campbell of First NationalBank of Chicago. Other factors supporting this bullish view were growingexpectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wouldbe reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan\'slarger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said. The dollar was also aided by Japan\'s moves to dampenspeculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active centralbank intervention to support the dollar. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week thatthe U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billiondlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amountsince the dollar crisis of the late 1970\'s. Discount Corp\'s McGroarty described the Fed\'s interventionvolume as \"impressive\". James O\'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,however: \"the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the tradedata are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and140 yen.\" Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New Yorkwarned, \"I don\'t think the dollar has bottomed out yet.\" Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okadasaid market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline ofthe U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure. Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reactionto the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,which is likely to focus on the implementation of previouscommitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives. President Reagan said today, \"economic policy decisionsmade last year in Tokyo and at this year\'s meetings of Group ofSeven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot beignored or forgotten.\" \"The commitments made at these meetings need to betranslated into action,\" he added in a speech, celebrating the40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe. Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear thebrunt of U.S. calls for further action. Marine Midland\'s O\'Neill said, \"pressure will build up onGermany to take stimulative action like Japan.\" Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollarcould hold above 145 yen for some months it could also comeunder attack again if it seems the latest economic package isnot having much impact on Japan\'s economy and its tradesurplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trustbanks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollarpositons hedged against exchange losses in their foreignportfolios, while some others have started covering those shortpositions, Japanese bank dealers said.

On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yenbut has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months. Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen farenough to ease the trade deficit\'s drag on the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in Marchfrom 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continuedimprovement in April in volume, if not in real, terms. Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that iffurther progress is reported, the dollar would head back uptowards 150 yen. \"There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomedout for the medium term,\" added Tom Campbell of First NationalBank of Chicago. Other factors supporting this bullish view were growingexpectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wouldbe reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan\'slarger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said. The dollar was also aided by Japan\'s moves to dampenspeculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active centralbank intervention to support the dollar. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week thatthe U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billiondlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amountsince the dollar crisis of the late 1970\'s. Discount Corp\'s McGroarty described the Fed\'s interventionvolume as \"impressive\". James O\'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,however: \"the dollar has not yet bottomed out.

Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reactionto the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,which is likely to focus on the implementation of previouscommitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.

{0 'Venezuela\'s central bank has orderedVenezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchangeoperations with brokers based outside the country, according toa copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters. The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, haseffectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela\'svolatile currency market. The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos HernandezDelfino, manager of the bank\'s department of internationaloperations. The telex said the restriction on business with foreignbrokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreignexchange houses from selling dollars or other foreigncurrencies to anyone living outside Venezuela. In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has deniedrumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls toprop up the weakening bolivar. But brokers said the central bank\'s move is seen as a defacto currency control. \"It is definitely a control in the sensethat there\'s no longer complete freedom to operate,\" one brokerhere said. \"Gradually they\'re imposing restrictions and the directionis towards complete control,\" the broker said. The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all hisVenezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him sincethe central bank issued the telex and followed it up withtelephone calls. He said that before the restriction was imposed the volumeof his firm\'s transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrsa day. \"It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,\" hesaid. The broker said he saw no logical explanation for theprohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediarybetween Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks. \"We weren\'t buying dollars from Venezuelans, that\'sridiculous,\" he said. \"They\'ve been on a rampage againstforeigners.\" The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela\'s centralbank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchangebusiness outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pctreserve requirement. In February, the central bank also prohibited trading inbolivar futures, the broker said. \"We used to have a forward market,\" he said. \"For a smallcurrency it was miraculous.\" He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current rangeof 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly runningout of foreign reserves to support the currency on the freemarket.

{0 'Bundesbank vice president HelmutSchlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now. With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down inMay and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that afurther cut in interest rates was needed. The economy is picking up, after contracting by aseasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter fromthe fourth, he added. \"We may have an increase in gnp startingin the second quarter,\" he said in an interview. Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has beenpressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost itsimports, either through fiscal or monetary policy. Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter wasmainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct. He estimated that economic growth for the year as a wholewould probably be between one and two pct. \"It is not a question of monetary conditions if domesticdemand does not grow strongly,\" he said, noting that interestrates are at historically low levels and funds are ample. Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank moneystock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year paceof 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank\'s three to sixpct target. He said the target could still be achieved but much willdepend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavyinflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMSrevaluation, boosted domestic money supply. \"There is still a certain hope that the net inflow offoreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bitreversed,\" Schlesinger said. A major reason for the inflows was the market\'s convictionthat the mark was headed higher. \"As we can see from the market,expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark havediminished,\" Schlesinger said. The recent widening of interest rate differentials, thefact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short periodand an improvement in real trade balances have all combinedtowards stabilizing the dollar, he said. Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollarrise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances. At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks. \"Central banks are always in contact about thesefluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,\"Schelsinger said. \"One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,\" he said,adding, \"It is not only our own case, it is also the Americancase.\" He said that the West German export industry has been hithard by the dollar\'s sharp fall and would probably like to seesome correction now. \"But it wouldn\'t be good to have short-termfluctuations,\" he said. \"Let us wait and see.\" \"It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a veryshort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level(of rates) as such,\" Schlesinger said. The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices ofsuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on WestGerman inflation down year. Although there have recently been signs of inflationpicking up, he said that this was due to changes in keycommodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year wouldbe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said. Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growthwas longer term, in that the economy was building up thepotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation. The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness oftargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at themid-year meeting of the Bundesbank\'s council, Schlesigner said.

Last year\'s GNPgrowth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct. \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resourcesand if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume thatdomestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated andwould not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said. \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking atkey indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,showed that the economy was on a different track from lastyear,\" he said. Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in thefirst and second quarters because of the dry weather, and itcould drop off in the third quarter. He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in themanufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986. \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said. He said the government had met all monetary targets set forthe first quarter in consultation with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourthtranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon. The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July orAugust to review performance in the January-June period. He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billiondlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find theirnet repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years. \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA(official development assistance) accounts the commercialbanking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said. It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMFdebt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said. The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March. Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos inApril 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started inOctober last year, had almost been completed. He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding leveltouched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.\"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said. Commenting on the country\'s foreign debt Fernandez said, \"Ithink the Philippine debt stock looms large because our ownreceipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leapforward as might have been suitable.\" The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987. NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the firstquarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs. Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth ofbetween six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that whilegrowth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved. Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by someeconomists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to thedollar, ought to be devalued to make the country\'s exports morecompetitive. \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the pesohas already substantially devalued against all of the country\'strading partners,\" he said. On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he wasopposed to a clause which would allow the unrestrictedrepatriation abroad of investments made during the first twoyears after the imposition of the Code. The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, hasbeen delayed by objections from some business groups. \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after theevents of the past two or two and a half years, has to beprudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the windsand I\'m not about to do that,\" Fernandez said. \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement ofcapital and earnings can be free,\" he said. \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainlywe continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our externalavailabilities simply by servicing our debts.\" REUTER',1 GNP}

{0 'Figures for first quarter 1987 WestGerman GNP will be published on June 11 after they wereprovisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the FederalStatistics Office said. The official said there had been a delay in gatheringinformation for the data, which are expected to show that theWest German economy contracted in the period. A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said therewas no political motivation behind publishing the figures onJune 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends. \"There is no political motivation. It is a purely technicalmatter,\" he added. The West German government is expected to come underpressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partnersto stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing internationaltrade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth. However, government officials have ruled out any furthertax reduction packages to supplement a major program ofstimulatory fiscal measures already underway. Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, thewidest measure of a country\'s economic activity, fell in realterms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the firstquarter compared with the fourth 1986 period. The government has confirmed that growth was negative inthe first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected tobe about two pct. Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank\'s reluctance tocut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,at three pct, is just above historical lows. West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venicesummit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,is already outstripping export performance, which has sufferedfrom an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just overtwo years. The government has pointed out that depressed exports arethe main reason for the current weakness in the economy, butsays that later in the year stronger domestic demand willcompensate for this setback. It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just undertwo pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986. REUTER',1 GNP}

{0 'For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl isthe scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who hasplayed a key role in shaping the world\'s financial destiny forthe last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of themark. President of the powerful and independent West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have hiscontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at theend of this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raisingeyebrows in West Germany\'s business community. The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in topministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now inopposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohlwould try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his ownChristian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has workedclosely and successfully with Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg since Kohl\'s government took office in 1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from PaulVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong internationalreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlookPoehl\'s past as an adviser to former Social Democrat ChancellorWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he wasFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, asChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In recent months, with the mark\'s strong rise against thedollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern ofthe Bundesbank\'s council, a highly conservative institutionwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to preventinflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two boutsof galloping inflation this century. But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, andinflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safeto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on thedangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate. \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise thedollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for theBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the markwould endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told businessjournalists in Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says thatPoehl\'s reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy. \"Poehl\'s policy has always been a policy which does notfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the externaleconomy,\" she said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to beidentified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it willcertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not sorigidly oriented towards money supply.\" One of Poehl\'s great struggles recently has been topersuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. ForPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was thatthe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilisecurrencies. The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currencydealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But infact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact. \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because theydon\'t know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says ofintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn ratesround, making a speculator\'s position worthless. Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalistin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes overa glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football andplay golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitutefor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced. \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amountif you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealersare very professional and skilled. \"They\'ve burnt the fingers ofmany people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

{0 'China will not increase sugar importssubstantially this year because of foreign exchange constraintsand large stocks, despite falling production and risingdomestic demand, traders and the official press said. \"Despite rapid increases in domestic production over thelast 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue tobe extremely serious,\" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, becausefarmers could earn more from other crops and because technicaland seed improvements had not been widely disseminated. The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a yearearlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year. The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlierfigure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New ChinaNews Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure. The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong provincefell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that thearea under sugar was dropping. \"Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,\" the newspapersaid. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation ofnearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of caneis a major problem.\" A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,south China\'s fourth major producer, where there was a drop inarea planted. He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were weldeveloped, enabling farmers to choose crops according to themaximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar. The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast provinceof Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only70 from one mu of sugarbeet. The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980. Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competedwith each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted infalling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills. The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, theofficial press has said. Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes ofsugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985. The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mlntonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier. A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocksin 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to importsugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986when the central government resumed control of imports. \"As China lacked storage, much of these imports was storedin Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,\" the diplomatsaid. The trader said transporting stocks from these areas toconsumers in east and south China was a problem, particularlyas coal had priority. \"How quickly they can move the sugar isone factor determining import levels,\" he said. Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,China\'s major supplier through barter trade, he said. \"China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about152/153 dlrs a tonne,\" he added. \"China is not a desperate buyernow. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go intothe open market.\" A Japanese trader said Peking\'s major concern regardingimports was price. \"While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,foreign exchange restraints persist,\" he said. The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about fivepct a year but \"a communist government is in a much betterposition to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if theforeign exchange situation demands it.\" REUTER',1 SUGAR}

{0 'Taiwan\'s central bank announced that asfrom today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of localand foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached atthe end of May. The central bank\'s statement added that the measure wouldbe effective until the end of July. Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow offoreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. Theyadded that the move, which sparked a record single day plungeof the local stock market, would limit their ability to lendforeign exchange to importers and exporters. Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banksreached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,according to official statistics. Last week the central bank said that from today it wouldreduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the movewas needed because of \"distortions\" in the foreign exchangemarket. Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbankmarket to avoid exchange rate losses. Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in Mayreached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9billion in April. All Taiwan\'s foreign exchange earnings must be convertedinto local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of boomingexports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct inthe year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions onremittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals toTaiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money. Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value ofthe local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs ofspeculative money into Taiwan since early last year.

But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves nowavailable to the authorities to support the pound should curbany market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show theruling Conservative Party\'s lead slipping, they added. \"We have been intervening to a very much greater extent thanwe have done hitherto,\" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid at a news conference today, commenting on the news of therecord reserves rise. He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvreaccord between leading industrial nations to stabilise thedollar, partly through direct intervention on foreignexchanges. \"We have been playing a very full part ourselves,\" hesaid. But market analysts see the recent upward pressure onsterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp downits rise, more in the light of local factors.

U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreignbuyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields asattractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notablyequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.

Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in statespending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for thefinancial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleasfrom the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes. \"Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, butsimply raising government spending and increasing the budgetdeficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,\" said Rob Lee,chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co. South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjustedgrowth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year ofless than one pct. Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled toover 30 pct. Economists estimate that the government\'s spending targetwill rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted ataround 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficitbefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct ofGDP. The government, having consistently overshot its ownspending targets for more than a decade, also faces acredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in thebudget, analysts said. \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\"said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview. Many analysts in the private sector are now paying lessattention to the figures presented in the budget and are usingtheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for themoney and capital markets. South African Mutual\'s Lee believes government spendingwill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by theIMF. \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predictedone analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily awayfrom austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the pasttwo years. The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in thepolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisistriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll overloans to the country in September 1985. Against a background of Western economic sanctions, fallingper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,government officials say economic growth is the primeobjective. But private-sector economists caution that the government\'sability to promote growth by boosting state spending isconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on thecurrent account of the country\'s balance of payments. Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on thenation\'s estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of anarrangement reached earlier this year with major internationalcreditor banks. Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis haslittle room to manoeuvre. Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries andbudgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office andSouth African Transport Services suggest that major taxconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.

{0 'The Louvre agreement by the Group of Sevenfinance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencieshas worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at theeconomic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said. Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produceany major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters workremained to be done on improving the conditions for lastingworld economic growth.\u001Eside measures to boost growth, he said. \"I think it is possible that there may be scope for afurther reduction in interest rates in Germany,\" he added, butstressed that he had had no indication that such a move waslikely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates. Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reductionof its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\" He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced\"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavycoordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, andhe was \"content\" with sterling\'s exchange rate. Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. Maycurrency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playinga very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to avery much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\" Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement mayfalter if member states did not implement the macro-economiccommitments underlying the accord. \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchangerate stability if countries are seen not to implement theircommitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S.Budget deficit was \"very important.\" Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced byJapanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawsonsaid, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase inmerchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\" \"There is a specific range of consumer and agriculturalgoods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which iswholly unjustified,\" he said. Lawson doubted that Tokyo\'s partners would indulge in \"Japanbashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulationpackage and the announcement of Nakasone\'s plans to increaseJapanese development aid over the next three years. Japan\'s more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchangemembership would also help deflect criticism, he said. He said he thought West Germany would instead come underpressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures tojack up faltering economic growth. In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bringforward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cutsscheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead withthe privatisation of German national industries. On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British planto alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries tomake progress in Venice. The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereigndebt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and WorldBank meetings in Washington earlier this year. Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backingfor the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme wouldbe finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank. He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and ChaseManhattan to increase sharply their Third World debtprovisions. \"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the marketresponse has shown that banks have much less to fear from thissort of move than they felt before Citicorp,\" he said. U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.\"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,\"Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves todetermine the appropriate size of provisions. He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would bediscussed at the summit. \"There is a consensus, which we have topush further.\" REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> intends to proceed withits planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd<MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from <Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>(ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters. ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier\'sissued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR\'s proposedbid. The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealandentrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pctstake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days. Herbert said Britain\'s Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which holdsjust under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid andhad told CSR it is not a seller. He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on itsoperations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built upa strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture. The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement withRedland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within sixmonths of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in thesame period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR. CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option. ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyonddescribing it as a long term investment. ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which isa leader in building materials, Herbert said. \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said. CSR has said that it will concentrate development on itscore businesses of sugar and building materials after its movesinto energy several years ago. Asked what he thought ETL\'s bid sought to achieve, Herbertsaid: \"I\'m puzzled as to what Hawkins\' strategy is. One has towonder if Monier is the main target.\" Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said ahigher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals. Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched itsoriginal bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April. The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents onyesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreignshareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment ReviewBoard (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval. Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likelyto accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judgethe respective values of ETL and CSR shares. ETL is the third group to become involved in a possibleacquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on apossible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but thenegotiations foundered on the price. Share analysts said that for this reason, they did notthink ETL\'s intervention would flush out a full Redland bidalthough Monier\'s ultimate fate rests in its hands. \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of<Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier havingCSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL. Monier\'s independent directors have recommended ETL\'s bid. REUTER',1 ACQ}
