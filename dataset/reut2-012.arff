{0 'Speculation the United States willoffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to havereached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary ofState George Shultz\' visit later this month to Moscow. Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheatmarkets since officials from the two countries held theircustomary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow\'sdecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn marketstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects. Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13. Shultz\' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand inthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export EnhancementProgram, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit toMoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representativeshere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration waspreparing an offer. Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lippedabout the prospects of a subsidy offer. But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned thecontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,while not a \"done deal,\" is a live possibility. Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whomasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that anoffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent. Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,are saying they would not rule one out. Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as topredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten daysto two weeks. Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaderswho had been in contact with administration officials. Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancementoffer would be made by the middle of this month. Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would endup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier thisyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrsper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat. Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheatsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases ofU.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans. As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat dealwould appear to be price. Last summer the administration took the controversial stepof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but wereembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the groundsthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat pricesfar above world market prices. The administration\'s decision to set the subsidy level upfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be ameans of controlling the price while attempting to dampencriticism, grain trade sources said. Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultzfrom saying the Soviets were \"chortling\" because Washington wasoffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available toU.S. housewives. The conventional wisdom among grain trade representativeshere is that a general warming of relations between the twocountries since last summer, combined with continued hard timesin the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer. In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would considerbuying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively. However, observers have not forgotten the circumstancessurrounding the administration\'s announcement of the wheatsubsidy offer last summer. Up until the time of the announcment, congressional andindustry leaders were led to believe the White House haddecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include notonly the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries. Instead, the administration scaled back the offer toinclude only the Soviets. That last-minute change of heart adds a measure ofuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convincedthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity tosell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

{0 'The restoration of coffee export quotasbefore the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by InternationalCoffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resumenegotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegatestold reporters. Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening thequota dialogue while Brazil\'s position remains unchanged, theysaid. Brazil\'s refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30pct share of the ICO\'s global export quota effectivelytorpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotasbefore October, the delegates noted. Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forcedcoffee futures in London and New York to new lows today,traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr inearly trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility ofreimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, inpractice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO\'s executive board session here this week has so farbarely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating generalunwillingness to revive talks while chances of success arestill remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored,despite the price collapse seen since the failure of lastmonth\'s negotiations, they said. \"With Brazil\'s frost season approaching, who wants tonegotiate quotas,\" one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil\'s frost season(mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks asinsurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil\'scrop. Many producers are more interested in working towardsreimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system ofquota allocations valid until the International CoffeeAgreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the \"other oilds\" producergroup should meet in the next two months to begin talks on howto allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quotadistribution system, with some producer delegates reportinggrowing support for a radical reallocation, based on theprinciple of \"objective criteria\" favoured by consumers. At last month\'s council session a splinter group of smallproducers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based onexportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia andthe rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocationsunchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers nowsupported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showedreadiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quotaaccord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined tomake reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution ofquota shares based on \"objective criteria.\" ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would beprepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meetsin September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on externaldebt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee,they said. They said Brazil\'s reluctance to open coffee exportregistrations might reflect fears this would provoke anotherprice slide and force an emergency ICO council session, whichwould most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situationbut had only a general discussion about how furthernegotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and thenmay set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are notfixed, he said. The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local timeto hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The boardmeeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled,delegates said.

{0 'Calls for a cut in Austrian interestrates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are dividedover the issue. Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse undKommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half apercentage point in interest rates across the board. But HannesAndrosch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> toldReuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers. Vak told a news conference that last January\'s cut inlending rates for commercial customers and for all depositorsby a quarter point had been insufficient. The January cut followed the National Bank\'s lowering ofits discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with asimilar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct anddeposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct. Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the GenossenschaftlicheZentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of apoint, or even half a point if German rates dropped further. Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. Awidening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West Germancredit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growththis year also justified a further interest drop, he said. Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank deroesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called forlower deposit rates but said lending rates should remainunchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,particularly when compared with other West European countries. But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste OesterreichischeSpar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unlessWest German rates came down first.

Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, withoutaccompanying policy changes, they stand little chance ofreversing the direction of an ever-growing global market inwhich more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, thesources said. \"Timing and psychology are the key to successfulintervention,\" said Jim O\'Neill, a financial markets economistwith Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementarychanges in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday whena change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantlyachieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for aweek through open market intervention. After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, thedollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50yen, up two yen from Tuesday\'s New York low. By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bankof Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billiondlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent thedollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year lowMonday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks havelost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar.The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a centralbank foray, but is no longer mesmerized. \"They\'ve lost their credibility. The market feels it cantake on the central banks and win,\" said Michael Snow, head oftreasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharpcontrast to the success that central banks scored when theyjoined forces to drive the dollar down following the September22, 1985, Plaza accord. Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it,because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrialpowers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower toredress massive worldwide trade imbalances. Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying thatthe dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit isshowing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting ina bid to protect its export industries. For its part, the United States is apparently content tolet the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little morethan lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Groupof Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say. Specifically, they said the Fed\'s dollar-buyingintervention has been half-hearted, designed more as apolitical gesture to Japan than to strike fear into themarkets. \"It\'s been pro-forma intervention,\" said FrancoiseSoares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais. Because of this discord and the market\'s momentum for alower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail. \"It\'s going to take a lot more than the central banks tohold the dollar (at these levels),\" said Snow, who predictsanother 10 to 15 pct depreciation. \"There have to be structural changes that occur to make themarket stop selling dollars,\" added \"Buying six billion dollarsin three weeks is not going to do it.\" Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter,when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack,central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billiondlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollarfalling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said. Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. \"Idon\'t think anybody has the stomach for it, because they sawthe futility of it in the seventies.\" Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and boundsince then, intervention on an even greater scale wouldprobably be needed to impress the market. Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone lastyear averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to ajoint central bank study, about double the previous estimatemade just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty privateresearch group. There are signs that central banks, too, realize thefutility of swimming against the tide. Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier thisweek that they believed the limits of currency marketintervention are perhaps being reached and that other methodsfor bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swapagreements with other central banks, are being considered. \"In this era of financial liberalization, it\'s almostimpossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,\"one senior official in Tokyo said.

{0 'Conrac Corp, whose board hasrejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV IndustriesInc <IV>, said it is exploring alternatives such as arestructuring, leveraged buyout or takeover of the company. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial andlegal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IVoffer, which it said it considers inadequate. The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by anothercompany, Conrac said. Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives atspecial meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision onwhether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on \"thefuture actions of Mark IV\" and its unsolicitied tender offer. Putting into effect any of the alternatives being exploredcould hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer, it said. Board members were also instructed to keep confidential theterms of any transaction that might be entered into until itbecomes final, the company said. The board also took other defensive steps, includinggranting severance agreements to some officers, it said. At a board meeting yesterday, Concac\'s directors deleted aprovision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of allclasses of its voting stock to call a special shareholdersmeeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders toremove directors without cause, the company said. The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said itplanned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at aspecial holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majorityof the company\'s common stock in the offer, Conrac said. Conrac\'s president, vice president and treasurer were givenseverance agreements, or \"golden parachutes,\" it said. Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would geta cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906dlrs last year, if there were a change of control in thecompany, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of thecompany\'s voting stock, Conrac said.

The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registeredmore than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires andworsened the flooding in various parts of the province. The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aireshave surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue. The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains. In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres areabordering on Uruguay. In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mmin places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm. The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa. Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also befurther delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said. The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of thecrops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added. Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa andBuenos Aires provinces. The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has beenlowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lowerthan the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season. The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86. The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of thearea sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Itwill begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weatherpermitting. Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mlntonnes, against last week\'s 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which privateproducers put 1985/86 production. The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the officialfigure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season\'s production. The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers\'targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week. The production forecast was reduced to between three and3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4to 26.8 pct down on last season\'s 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mlnhectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86. The forecast for soybean yield this season was the leastchanged in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes. These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season\'srecord of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes. The adjustment to the production forecast is due to therains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced thesunlight needed for this crop, sources said. Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted downfurther. The humidity could induce rotting and growers are stillfinding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlierin the season.

{0 'Emery Air Freight Corp topped aleveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offermay surface. Purolator\'s stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 overEmery\'s 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per shareor 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc. Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer forPurolator exceeded their expectations. Several analysts previously had said they saw takeovervalues for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per sharerange. At least one, however, estimated the company could betaken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share. Analysts today would not venture to say whether anotheroffer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to thebelief that the bidding could go higher. \"They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.Emery has shown the courage to go forth,\" said one arbitrager,who speculated other courier companies may also emerge asbidders. \"It makes sense,\" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.But \"It won\'t make out as well as they think. They won\'t get a100 pct of the synergies.\" Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings inthe short term, but long term, after eliminating redundanciesand selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery\'sprofitability. Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rivalUnited Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. packagedelivery company after Federal Express Corp <FDX>, which has 47pct of the market. Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator wouldhave about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr deliverybusiness. \"This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight(delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,\"said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co. Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, andits chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call. E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period onits offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST. One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likelyHutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical acompany outside the package delivery industry would want tooutbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company. Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by someof its management and the E.F. Hutton Group <EFH> subsidiary,speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come. The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolatorboard member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said hebelieved a better offer could be made by another entity. A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director hadno contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers linedup for Purolator. Purolator\'s deal with Hutton was also called into questionby a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attemptedto stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday. Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer couldbe bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning tokeep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279mln dlr \"bridge\" loan that would later be replaced with otherdebt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator. Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk nits investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its279 mln dlr loan. Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mlndlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs inrevenues. Reuter',1 ACQ}
{0 '<Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>said it was lowering the interest rate on its Visa credit cardto 15.9 pct from 18.6 pct, effective with the May billingstatement. The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card userfee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for eachtransaction. A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by theCanadian Parliament\'s finance committee on March 20 for asubstantial cut in credit card rates \"was a factor\" in themove, but he would not elaborate. Canada\'s minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin hadthreatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply tounpaid balances, if the financial institutions did notvoluntarily act.

{0 'Rumors that New York investor AsherEdelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimismabout tomorrow\'s status hearing on the patent infringement suitpending with Eastman Kodak Co <EK> sent Polaroid\'s stockhigher, traders said.

Edelman had no comment on the rumors. A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not beencontacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with theSecurities and Exchange Commission about a stake in thecompany. \"There is some hope among investors that there will someprogress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patentinfringement suit with Kodak,\" analyst Michael Ellmann ofWertheim and Co said.

{0 'New York coffee futures prices willprobably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before aconsolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts. Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after theInternational Coffee Organization did not place new exportquota discussions on its current agenda. Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after fiveyears of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February. \"Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents,perhaps 85 cents,\" said William O\'Neill, coffee analyst withElders Futures. \"But the additional downside may not be allthat great from current levels.\" \"At this price level the market is very vulnerable tobullish developments,\" O\'Neill added. \"Rather than us having amarket that will plummet we\'ll kind of see prices erode --probably to around 85 cents.\" \"I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a briefdrop to 85 cents,\" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst withPrudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freezein Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time. A trader at a major international trade house, who askednot to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term butbelieves if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively highexport price and requires a high contribution quota fromexporters the market could steady at the lower levels. Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount onBrazil to agree to consumers\' export quota terms, and a newinternational agreement could come into force next fall. Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallenfrom about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lbtoday, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply anddemand. Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup ofstocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and willneed to do some buying soon. \"Most producing nations have just completed or are about tocomplete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are attheir seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago andwarehouses in producer nations are becoming increasinglyoverburdened,\" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for ShearsonLehman, in that firm\'s forthcoming quarterly coffee report. Kaul said producers\' need to procure hard currency toservice foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,and \"this should keep substantial pressure on exporters toundertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.\" Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb beforeBrazil\'s frost season begins in June. Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,though analysts note the peak winter consumption period ispassed and demand usually slows this time of year. Shearson\'s Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as ofJanuary 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bagscompared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdownfor the usually busy winter roasting season. But Elders O\'Neill said, \"The roasters are not overstockedby any means.\" Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territorybelow the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and severaltraders said the sidelines might be preferable for the shortterm.

{0 'U.S. refiners said they are worriedthat growing supplies of imports, proposed federalenvironmental regulations, and the marketing of a third gradeof unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time whenthe industry is recovering from a recent slump. \"We have to look at national security and cut the amountof products and crude coming into the country if it hurts theindustry,\" said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleumproducts at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD). U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S.consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid1990s, according to the Department of Energy. \"Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oilrequirements 15 or so years from now?\" asked John Swearingen,chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp <CIL> andformer chief executive of Amoco Corp <AN>. \"If your answer tothat question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all thatwe can now to cope with this situation and improve ourposition.\" But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, aview echoed by others attending this week\'s National PetroleumRefiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas. \"Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouragingbecause those things won\'t solve our problems and could wellcompound them,\" said Swearingen. \"Once the government affectsvalues, once an import quota or license has value, it\'s goingto be subverted by government,\" he added. William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs ofan import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as EnergySecretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits toencourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He alsosaid altnerative energy sources should be encouraged. Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pctdeduction from the taxable income of oil companies is controversal but might work, said Dunham. Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oilimports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude andproduct imports. \"Why would companies import crude when they could importproducts for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?\"asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum<CNP>. An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemicalproducts and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunhamsaid. \"The energy security issue should be considered whenenvironmental issues are considered,\" Martin said. \"The level of investment for the proposed lowering ofsulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, isunacceptable,\" Dunham said. \"Most companies cannot afford it.\" George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said theseproposals \"will place pressure on small refining operations andpromote further industry consolidation.\" An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released atthe conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pctweight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highwaydiesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs. The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while theaverage aromatics content was 32 pct. Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading offacilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline whichis beginning to be marketed by some companies. \"What will be the standard octane level in various gradesof unleaded gasoline?\" asked Dunham. \"A midlevel grade ofunleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means aninvestment has to be made,\" Dunham said. This grade is not warranted, said Crown\'s Rosenberg. Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins tomove higher in the next few months. \"We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,\"said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketingcompany that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA>. Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S.stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasolinedemand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said. \"This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,\"Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarilya gasoline producer.

{0 'After an already steep fall in the pastweek, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declinesin the near term, financial analysts said. However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bondfutures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and thecontracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery beforeresuming their decline. Key to the near-term direction of futures will be thecourse of the dollar, they said. \"As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,\" said DeanWitter analyst Karen Gibbs. The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year lowagainst the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday whenseveral large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised theirprime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct. \"Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar declineis over,\" Gibbs said. The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debtfutures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation. Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at themeeting of the Federal Reserve\'s policy making arm, the FederalOpen Market Committee, this week, analysts said. \"To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, asteepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices looksuspiciously like the traces of expectations of acceleratinginflation,\" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEnteeand McGinley Inc. Such expectations could mean that \"a shift in policy towardrestriction of bank reserves is likely to get very seriousconsideration,\" at the FOMC meeting, he said. Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highlyvisible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said. Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found inseasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, hesaid. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mlndlrs over the past several months, he said. In the meantime, however, \"the market looks a bitoversold,\" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.

{0 'The U.S. House Agriculture Committeeapproved proposals to extend the life of the Export EnhancementProgram, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reaganadministration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union. The proposals were approved as amendments to acomprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year. In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committeeapproved several proposals which could restrict imports oflamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Thoseamendments affecting imports face an uncertain future becausethe House Ways and Means Committee, which has overalljurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,Congressional sources said. The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend thelife of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather thanthe current three years through fiscal 1988. The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., alsowould increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from1.5 billion now. Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered byRep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Departmentto value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisitionvalue. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pctless expensive to operate. The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered byRep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administrationmake an offer, but urges such action. The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. GlennEnglish, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture tobegin discussions with other major grain producing countriesaimed at jointly reducing world grain production. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed theamendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work. Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approvedby the panel, the most significant would require quotas onimports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farmproduct that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offeredby Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily atcurbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar andforeign foods containing dairy products. It also may affectpeanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said. Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports ofcasein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by NewZealand and Ireland. The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the samecountercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.beef imports. Other miscellaneous amendments included: -- Urging the administration consider retaliating againstJapan and South Korea if those countries do not removerestrictions on beef imports. -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shippedeach year under a food aid program called Section 416 to800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study ofthe Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat todetermine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse theNational Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for thecosts of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against aCanadian countervailing duty case this year. -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decisionto apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by theEuropean Community to apply a vegetable oils tax. -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a NationalCommission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended areorganization of USDA\'s trade policy apparatus.

The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend thelife of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather thanthe current three years through fiscal 1988. The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., alsowould increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from1.5 billion now. Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered byRep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Departmentto value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisitionvalue. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pctless expensive to operate. The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered byRep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administrationmake an offer, but urges such action. The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. GlennEnglish, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture tobegin discussions with other major grain producing countriesaimed at jointly reducing world grain production. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed theamendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work. Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approvedby the panel, the most significant would require quotas onimports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farmproduct that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offeredby Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily atcurbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar andforeign foods containing dairy products. It also may affectpeanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said. Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports ofcasein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by NewZealand and Ireland. The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the samecountercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.beef imports. Other miscellaneous amendments included: -- Urging the administration consider retaliating againstJapan and South Korea if those countries do not removerestrictions on beef imports. -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shippedeach year under a food aid program called Section 416 to800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study ofthe Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat todetermine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse theNational Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for thecosts of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against aCanadian countervailing duty case this year. -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decisionto apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by theEuropean Community to apply a vegetable oils tax. -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a NationalCommission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended areorganization of USDA\'s trade policy apparatus.

{0 'Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has seen aslow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Credit business declined in the first few weeks of theyear, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weakGerman bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, andtrading in securities also fell. But earnings from currencydealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference. Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balancesheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion. Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of theformer Flick group, which have been estimated at some onebillion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank\'sown account, not included in partial operating profits. Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through asubsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interestsurplus in a section current earnings from securities andparticipations. In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from1.45 billion. As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits. But it said that total operating profits, including ownaccount trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flicktransaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in theparent bank. Banking analysts said this put group total operatingprofits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bankoperating profits at over five billion marks. Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earningsfrom Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of itsunchanged 12 mark dividend. The bank had decided against raising the dividend itselfbecause of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,and developments so far this year showed that was correct,Christians said. West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they aresure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequentyears, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits. The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue ahigh level of risk provision, Christians said. Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in1986 from 765 mln in 1985. Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarilyreflect the full amount of risk provisions. Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen saidDeutsche\'s total debt exposure to problem countries had fallento over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985because of the fall in the dollar. He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds ofsuch problem country debt had been written off. Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of \"othersecurities,\" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in theparent bank. Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly dueto its increased activity in international share placements,with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA\'s internationalplacement last year remaining on its books. Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned toplace these shares and conclude the original placement. Reuter',1 EARN}

Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding fromDeutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal withCreditanstalt. Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover ofLloyds Bank plc <LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said. Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recentcapital increase of <Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had noplans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell. <Banca d\'America e d\'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct wasacquired from Bankamerica Corp <BAC.N> late last year, would beconsolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion ofDeutsche\'s business, management board joint spokesman F.Wilhelm Christians said. Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal HighCourt, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in thebalance sheet section \"participations,\" Christians said. But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in thesenon-bank companies as an investment rather than an activeparticipation. Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marksin 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a riseto 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.

The banks following the trend are the <Overseas Union BankLtd>, <United Overseas Bank Ltd>, <Oversea-Chinese BankingCorporation> and the <Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>. The shift towards securitisation has been helped byvolatile financial markets which have developed hedgingfacilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for riskmanagement, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun. Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks seelimited growth in credit risk. More and more of them areswitching from term lending to major growth areas such asstockbroking and fee based income, he said. Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after beinggranted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are nowmoving into the new government securities market and the StockExchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System. One foreign banker said the Development Bank and theOverseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equitymarket in Singapore. Loh said the banks\' participation in the stock market hasincreased business transactions and provided long term growthfor the market. The banks are not competition for individualstockbroking firms because of the increased business theygenerate, he added. Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expandequity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year becauseof the increasing ability of foreign and local marketparticipants to absorb new issues. Loh said <OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary ofthe Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm tolaunch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investorsseeking capital growth through a diversified internationalportfolio. It will invest in international shares with theemphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said. <DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of theDevelopment Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong KongStock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm. Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates inSingapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will beforced to provide fund management services for major clientsseeking better returns, he said. Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the majorbanks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income fromtreasury and investment banking activities.

Overseas Union\'s profits are expected to jump to over 40mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.

{0 'A Japanese businessman announced plans fora new telecommunications firm in which Britain\'s Cable andWireless Plc would be a core company. However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation ofEconomic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does notspecify what stake Cable and Wireless would have. \"The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,\"Watanabe said in a statement. \"The actual percentage ofshareholdings should be agreed by the core companies.\" He said the eight core companies will provide directors forthe firm. \"The new company shall immediately set to work on thefeasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,\"Watanabe said. Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against<Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan\'soverseas telephone business. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wantsonly one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe\'s efforts. A British source, who declined to be identified further,said the proposals could open the door to further talks betweenC and W <CAWL.L> and the other firms involved. C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal whichwould have given it a five pct share in the newtelecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pctstake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stakein one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge. The British source said the decision not to specify theexact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the dooropen for further discussion. \"It\'s probably a sensible approach on their part,\" theBritish source told reuters. C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay anew cable between Japan and the U.S. The proposed merger has sparked an international row, withBritish government sources threatening retaliatory actionagainst Japan for what they see as discriminatory practicesagainst foreign firms. The sources said last Friday that one option for Britainwould be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securitiescompanies operating in London. The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,saying that both rival consortia should be licensed. Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,Watanabe said, \"They will not be core companies but if they wishthey could participate.\" Under the Japanese law, total foreignparticipation would be limited to one-third. \"It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which hasthe support of many influential backers and work within thisfor the realization of their ideas,\" Watanabe told reporters. The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>, Mitsuiand Co <MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp <SUMT.T>, Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co <MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co<CITT.T>, and <Pacific Telesis International Inc>. Watanabe said that his latest proposal represented hisfinal effort. If it fails to satisfy the British government, it will beup to the Japanese government to explain its position, he said.

The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costsand boosting efficiency of the grain handling system. Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat marketshare because its competitors are supplying cheaper butlower-quality grades, the AWB submission said. It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at everystage from receival to shipping. Better industrial relations at grain terminals, moreuniform transport systems across the states and extensive stockcontrol were vital to improved marketing, it said. The submission also said Australia\'s federal system impededthe AWB\'s role of coordinating and managing the marketing ofwheat. The AWB called for an end to physical and legislativeconstraints at state borders that prevent the efficienttransport of grains to other states for shipment. \"It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic modeto the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state inwhich the wheat is grown or stored,\" it said. For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than toSydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly,southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland orGeelong, in Victoria. Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly overgrain shipments was one notable impediment, it said. The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulkhandling authorities is not essential, although it said itfavoured the authorities maintaining at least their currentlevel of control of storage and transport as long as qualitywas maintained. An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel atvarious Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houstonand 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

{0 'Chemicals group BayerAG <BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986. The company said that this was despite the mark\'s furtherstrengthening against the dollar and other currencies anddespite an increase in competitive pressure. \"The further progress of our business will depend largely onthe extent to which threats to free trade materialise and onthe developments of exchange rates, raw material and energycosts. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billionmarks in 1986, exceeding the previous year\'s record of 3.15billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication ofthe likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985results, up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declinedslightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showeda further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainlythe sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also broughtpressure on selling prices, it added. In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against1985, the company said without giving details. \"The western Europe, North America and Far East regionsdeveloped well in local currency, but here too the translationof local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,especially in the case of North America,\" it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combinedwith savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offsetfalling prices and cost increases in other areas. The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lowerextraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating rawmaterials all developed well, it said. Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that worldgroup turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last threemonths of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period. Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pctto 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower andforeign turnover 8.6 pct lower. Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarteragainst 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985. REUTER',1 EARN}

{0 '<San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and <UnitedCoconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on adisputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of agovernment panel that controls the sequestered shares said. Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on GoodGovernment (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB. \"It looks good,\" Diaz said. But he added several issues,including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares,had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to thesale. The PCGG\'s sequestration last year of 33 mln shares abortedSMC\'s bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in theUCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares wereactually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate offormer President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB whenhe fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration. \"The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB areowned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,\" Diaz said. \"Naturally we donot want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.\" PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a downpayment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC\'s Hong Kong subsidiaryNeptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year. The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would beforfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed tofulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originallynegotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos. PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines\' largest food andbeverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln \"B\" class sharesfrom the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at aprice of 150 pesos per share. The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion pesotransaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferredshares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollecteddividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced toUCPB-controlled trading companies. The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per sharemade by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15pct stock dividend declared in June last year. A spokesman for SMC said the company\'s 15-member board mettoday to discuss the proposed compromise. The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the boardmeeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration. President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB toset up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownershipissue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15. Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMCboard, filed a formal complaint before the Securities andExchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight otherdirectors of violating \"fiduciary duty.\" De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC\'sboard last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.

In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy,Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting hewas comfortable with sterling exchange rates around currentlevels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.

{0 'Mellon Bank Corp said it expectsto report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mlnto 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share. The company also said it intends to reduce its secondquarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts. Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in thefirst quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs incharge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-lossreserve. It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cashbasis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs. In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrsor 2.13 dlrs a share. Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs andincreased provisions address four areas of concern in thebank\'s wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,developing countries, some basic industrial companies andseveral commercial real estate businesses. Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the firstquarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct ofthe loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct oftotal loans at the end of 1986. Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of thefirst quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines. Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986. Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement inenergy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lackof a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent toincrease reserves and take losses on loans in this sector. \"This action relates both to loans to companies directlyinvolved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,home builders and financial institutions in the SouthwesternUnited States,\" Barnes said. As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mlndlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but hadcharged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt. He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quitBrazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term creditlines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil andother sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts. Loans to basic industries were not major contributors tothe increase in non-performing assets or to first-quartercharge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about theabsence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries. The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continuedmanagement cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon hasthe financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,Barnes said. \"We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presentlytrouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing themaggressively,\" he added.

{0 'The European Community responded towidespread U.S. criticism of its trade policies by publishingan extensive list of U.S. actions which pose obstacles to ECexports. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to asimilar document issued by U.S. Administration officials inNovember, and updated a previous EC list. EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercqsaid its object was to show such actions were not solely takenby trading partners of the U.S. And that \"the U.S. Were notinnocents in the matter.\" The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercialrelations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariffmeasures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumpingprocedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies. The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned werenecessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations,and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcominginternational trade talks. \"The purpose of the report is to makeclear that trade practices which impede exports are not aunique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans facesimilar problems in the U.S.,\" it said. Among the obstacles detailed in the report are importrestrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup,certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms andmachine tools. It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports.The document said the U.S.\'s three-year export enhancementprogram (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidiesgranted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added. \"The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S.EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and willcontinue to do so,\" it said, adding the current GATT round wouldalso provide an opportunity to address the subject. The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S.On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts andcertain cottons, restrict EC exports. In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accordon semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers,standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S.Administration\'s \"buy American\" public procurement policy.

British Petroleum currently owns about 55 pct of StandardOil\'s outstanding common stock and to acquire the remainder atthe tender offer price of 70 dlrs per share would cost 7.4billion dlrs.

{0 'The Nigerian naira firmed against thedollar, banking sources said, after the rules governing foreignexchange auctions at the central bank were changed. The marginal rate set at today\'s auction, from whichreporters were barred for the first time since the sessionsbegan last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said. Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operationfor the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreignexchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at therate of the lowest successful bid. The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from biddinghigh and thus driving down the naira\'s value. But bankingsources and other analysts said demand for foreign exchangeremained sharply higher than the available funds. Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight,instead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offercompared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week. The rule change appeared to have an immediate impact onbids. Today\'s highest bid was 4.06 to the dollar, compared witha top bid of 4.25 two weeks ago. Banks who bid higher than the marginal rate will be able topass on their rate to their customers, while the marginal ratewill only act as a marker for transactions. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}
{0 'Coffee prices look set to continuesliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards anew International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotaaccord, according to coffee traders and analysts. Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lowsyesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, whenthe lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmedexpectations that efforts to restore quotas would not berevived at this stage, they said. The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 centsa lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years. Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO\'s annualSeptember council session, and in the interim the Brazilianfrost season from June to August may prove the only bullishfactor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futuresbounced back from the lows today towards the previous tradingrange around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the marketrecovered from yesterday\'s \"confidence blip,\" one tradercommented. But despite today\'s upturn, the overall trend is for lowerprices in the near future, one trade source said. The market had become increasingly vulnerable toyesterday\'s shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stgsecond position trading range for 22 successive sessions, hesaid. Technically the market is more likely to decline further asit absorbs today\'s brief rally. Steep declines towards the1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a \"three figure mentality,\" andspeculators may elect to push for coffee prices below thepsychological 1,000 stg level, he added. Some traders said today\'s upturn was in part due toBrazil\'s opening last night of May green coffee exportregistrations. This had been widely anticipated by the market and came asno surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty andlight trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence. However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test ofsupport at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the onlypossible supportive influence on the horizon being the approachof Brazil\'s frost season, they said. Roasters are believed to be well covered, limitingactivities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally nottaking up producer offers, they added. Central American producers have sold the bulk of theircurrent crops, but robusta producers in West Africa andIndonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment,and this could pressure prices further, traders said. However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to bebullish, advised caution. \"Everybody\'s bearish now, just as theywere bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg,\" he said. Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expresseddoubts the price spiral would continue much below currentlevels. \"One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers --there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall.\" While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retailprices. \"Its impossible to say, we can\'t predict anything like thatat this stage,\" a General Foods spokesman said. Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway inresponse to market weakness. At the beginning of March theprice of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue tofall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added. Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts inthe near future. \"The market seems to have established some equilibrium anddoesn\'t look set to go much lower,\" a Nestle spokesmancommented. Coffee\'s plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, whichfell to a 5-1/2 year low at today\'s auction at 1.18 stg perkilo for medium quality, traders added. Reuter',1 COFFEE}

Sterling ended its European day at 1.6020/30 dlrs,virtually unchanged from yesterday\'s last 1.6040/50 dlrs,fetched before Lawson\'s first comment. But it was well up onlevels just above 1.59 dlrs which it had held until the secondcomment came.

We are back towhere we were before,\" Mark Brett, economist at securities houseBarclays de Zoete Wedd said. \"This whole story is like a storm in a teacup,\" a dealer witha U.K. Bank commented.

In this context, Lawson was reported to have specifiedrates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound inremarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal tosell sterling. Lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday\'sapproximate value of the pound. \"The wrong end of the stick was picked up,\" he toldreporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change inBritish exchange rate policies. Dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statementswere clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relativecurrency stability after the February 22 Paris agreement, wasdesperate to reactivate trading and would react to any cluesoffered about the contents of the currency accord. In Paris, finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canadaare widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets,although no participant has specified these in an apparent bidto foster stability by keeping markets guessing. \"The markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on Groupof Six (countries that are part to the Paris agreement) targets...

Analysts said neither yesterday\'s remarks nor today\'s hadchanged their impression that after Paris, sterling wastargeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies.

{0 'Amoco Corp first quarter profits areexpected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share,reported for 1986\'s fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrowsaid. Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, hesaid the gain was expected because of higher oil and gasprices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986\'sfirst quarter. Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco\'s firstquarter refining and marketing results \"will look pretty poor,\"because of low margins in January and February. The marginsbegan to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added. Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain goodfor the rest of the year, \"but it remains to be seen if theywill match 1986 levels.\" The Amoco chairman said he expectscrude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range forthe rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC\'s agreement willhold. Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level wouldresult in a 40 pct increase in oil company explorationspending. President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amocoreduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by atotal of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a dropin oil and gas prices. Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires thatreserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end priceswill remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said thedrop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserveestimate by four pct. Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gasliquids production to decline about five pct this year fromlast year\'s 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals madelast year when oil prices were falling. He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by thepurchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels perday to the company\'s 1987 U.S. production. Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to beincreasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-freegasoline, especially the higher octane grades. He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vaporpressure will further tighten the industry\'s gasolineproduction capacity. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn.,would require quotas on the import of any merchandisecontaining over 25 pct sugar or other farm products which arenow subject to U.S. quotas. Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbingshipments of food products containing sugar from Canada.However, the Ways and Means committee, which has overalljurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill theamendment as protectionist, a committee aide said. An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposalprobably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees.But he said the amendment was introduced in part to send awarning to U.S. companies considering moving food processingplants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota. In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep. Stangeland andother supporters said the proposal would have no effect on thestatus of foreign trade zones.

{0 'There is little scope for a substantialincrease in U.S. interest rates during 1987, said FederalNational Mortgage Association chairman David Maxwell. Speaking to the New York Financial Writers\' Association,Maxwell said he viewed this week\'s rise in U.S. banks\' prime rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon. \"I don\'t see a substantial rise in rates this year. Ifanything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than totighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of theeconomy are showing weakness,\" Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buysmortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities. Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last twoyears had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Aone pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said.

{0 'Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream,Dijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to thesupermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitzfor national-brand \"gourmet\" coffees. General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A andP, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are theonly two national brand roasters so far to introduce thehigher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets. But industry insiders believe there is substantial growthpotential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales inregular ground roast types. \"I would suspect General Foods will make a name forthemselves with their gourmet line,\" said a coffee tradesource. \"What it could do is really dent the small-store,whole-bean business,\" the trade source added. The new lines are designed to appeal to a classicadvertising composite--the \"yuppie\" consumer. They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine andwere \"first on their block with a wok,\" as described by KarinBrown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee,called Private Collection out of GF\'s Maxwell House division. Paul Gallant, president of A and P\'s Compass Foodssubsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, describedits potential appeal as \"a status thing.\" At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it isexpensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold insmall specialty stores. General Foods\' Maxwell House Div. hasjust cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrsfor 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,according to an A and P executive. Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has \"nothing to announce atthis point\" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither doesHills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third andfourth size market spot by volume with A and P. Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress ofGeneral Foods\' offering, prepared to jump in if the markettakes off. General Foods and A and P hope their new products will helppush coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption inthe United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales showno signs of picking up. Compass\'s Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffeequality since the 1960\'s and aggressive soft drink marketing. \"The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the nameof profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers thiswas quality coffee,\" Gallant said. As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for thebrew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, \"they turnaround and say \'My God this is awful, I think I\'ll have aCoke\',\" he said. Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who haveconfirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers areaiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd-- the yuppie composite. \"Where else are you going to go?,\" an industry source said.\"Kids aren\'t going to drink coffee, that\'s apparent. There areno other markets. The only area that\'s not been promoted isgourmet,\" he said. In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmetline could provide much higher margins to roasters than regularground roast coffees produce. Generally, retail prices are about twice the price ofgreen, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs ofroasting, packaging and distribution, and then deductingoften-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sellcoffee near the trade price as a \"loss leader,\" a productdesigned to draw shoppers into the store. But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricingstructure prevails, industry sources said. There is no tradediscounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including aspecial valve designed to keep the beans fresher. Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality greenbeans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmetcoffee are now almost three times the price of green. Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test marketsurveys for Private Collection came back for more. And product manager Brown points to the success of moreexpensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling inrestricted high income areas and are now available in almostevery supermarket in the country. A and P is similarly optimistic. \"We think we\'ll doextremely well in the gourmet market,\" Gallant said. Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of PrivateCollection in selected high income areas, while A and P offersits 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O\'ClockRoyale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

An additional 20 mlnacres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program,bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres,almost a third of the nation\'s total 235 mln acre crop base. Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 willprobably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup instocks, analysts said. \"It\'s a substantially different story from last year whenwe added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile,\" VernonMcMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said. Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likelytranslate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels. McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resultingin a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpileof 5.45 billion bushels. \"To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we\'reat least in a holding pattern,\" George Hoffman, director ofcommodity analysis for Pillsbury said. Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to \"significantly less\"domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices. USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage andsaid wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least notincrease. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, nextyear\'s projected crop could be used up, an analyst said. \"We won\'t be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreagereductions, that would be an improvement,\" an AgricultureDepartment wheat analyst said. Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be thesmallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lowerfinal production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to100 mln bushels, analysts said. As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in theconservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programswill be more effective because they will force more highproducing land out of production, a USDA analyst said. \"We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very longtunnel,\" the analyst said.

The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports toPakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, whileimports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenyaprovides over 50 pct of Pakistan\'s tea imports. The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did notcome as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of thetrade imbalance for some time. \"We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ...(it) will certainly hurt Kenya\'s tea industry in the short termas Pakistan is Kenya\'s second largest market,\" a source at onebroking house told Reuters. One tea broker said Pakistan\'s move had already affectedKenya\'s tea trade and was largely responsible for an averagefall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasalast Monday. \"The trend is likely to continue until other countriesreplace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,\"he added. Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan,Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as majormarkets for its tea, the sources added.

{0 'The recent fall in world sugar prices,due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of exportavailability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from Chinaand the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said. Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic ofChina at the lower end of the recent price range, which shouldlimit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthlymarket report. \"And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to returnto the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes forMay/June shipment, Man added. The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/Mayshipment towards the end of last month, which brings its totalpurchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said. Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mlntonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is beingcountered by a reduction in China\'s production forecast to 5.3mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier. Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop couldbe close to last year\'s 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similarproduction Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down. Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocksin September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used toboost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will notbe able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimatesCuba\'s export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mlntonnes. However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporterswith reduced availability, Man said. Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallento 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time freemarket demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, whichhas left exporters chasing falling import requirements. A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But thedifficult task of keeping production advances at bay stillremains, as at least one more season of production deficit isneeded to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks stilloverhanging the market, Man said. The increasing cases of record production as a result ofrecord yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producersto strive for greater efficiency. As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost ofproduction, sugar exporters may become more responsive toprices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said. Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission andsugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in thelevel of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fullycompensate producers when exporting on the world market. Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugaris expected to remain in intervention, it added. REUTER',1 SUGAR}

Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against aprevious target of 3.5 pct. Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the centralbank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing atan annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to fourpct if the government were to meet its five pct inflationtarget this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986. The forecast for private consumption growth remainsunchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revisedupwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct. Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected toincrease by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct. Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from5.2 pct due to the peseta\'s continuing strength against thedollar and slack external demand. Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spendinghas lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from anearlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.

{0 'French sugar producer Beghin-Say is notcurrently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed intointervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded atthis week\'s European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-SayPresident Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters. The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos onWednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders. Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission hasstarted to move in the right direction, but said his companyhad no plans to change its decision to put sugar intointervention. But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a finalagreement would be reached with the commission which wouldallow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention. European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar intointervention to protest about export rebates which they say aretoo low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by thecommission on Wednesday, according to commission sources. Under EC regulations, however, operators have another fourto five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention beforepayment is made for it. A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnesof West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, tradesources said here. This amount represents about a third ofannual EC exports to non-EC countries. Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it hadoffered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000tonnes. Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus onevery 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fullybridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday\'s rebatewas 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get anequivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traderssaid. Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates tothe full intervention price and said Wednesday\'s tender was astep in the right direction. Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorisedfor export since the begining of the current campaign had beeninadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate. Trade sources said new regulations governing exportrebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth thepath for the commission to award larger export rebates infuture. One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemedthe commission had understood the protest action and was nowmoving towards adapting the situation accordingly, therebyallowing the operators to withdraw their sugar fromintervention once they got satisfaction.

{0 'West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris inFebruary had been successful and would be continued. Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week\'sInternational Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: \"The ...Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels hasproven its worth and will also determine future developments.\" Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what hewould consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollararound 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany\'s exports. Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations hadmade it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan majorefforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreigntrade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy. \"No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, theU.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strongunder-valuation,\" he said. Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in aswift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning thecurrent trade dispute over semi-conductors. Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Pariscurrency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically butnoted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had notbeen published. The Paris declaration did not state the levels at whichcentral banks of the major industrialised countries wouldintervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefullyconsidered. He said he had nothing further to add. Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany wasnow no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government tostimulate its economy. He declined to respond specifically to a question on thissubject but said, \"You must attach particular importance to theconsensus which was reached in Paris.\" The minister nevertheless added that he would make clearduring his trip to Washington that West Germany\'s nominal tradefigures gave a false impression about actual trade flows. Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn\'s exports fell by anominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct.West Germany\'s imports dropped largely because of foreigncurrency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to arecord trade surplus last year. However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany\'sexports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real importshad risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct. In this way West Germany had made its contribution toeconomic stability, Stoltenberg added. Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to riseby a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating. He said it was too early to revise official forecasts forWest Germany\'s economic growth this year. The government hasforecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product. The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is stillexpecting growth of three pct but some other researchinstitutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct.Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how manyimponderables had to be taken into account and said no drasticchanges in official forecasts were needed.

Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>,told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the maindangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar aswell as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harmingearnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at thestart of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, wasbadly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover wasmainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 andcompetition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings fromlower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by pricecompetition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemicalfirms were slightly worse than the year before but the improvedfinancial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase productionin the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out ofWest Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall inexports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far Eastexports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.

{0 'The departure of James Baker\'sclosest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, willnot change the course of Washington\'s domestic andinternational economic policies, U.S. officials said. Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, waswidely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives oncurrency management and international economic cooperation. U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role inshepherding President Reagan\'s sweeping tax reform plan throughthe U.S. Congress. But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure,to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers,signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the TreasurySecretary himself might leave soon. \"It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as itcame up,\" one official said. Another commented, \"Baker will miss him, but he\'s not goingto stand in his way.\" There has been widespread speculation since last autumnthat Darman sought a Wall Street job. Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform latelast year marked an appropriate moment to bow out. Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed. \"Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of thisadministration over the past six years and his departurerepresents a substantial loss,\" he said. U.S. Officials admitted Darman\'s absence would be anundoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policyadvice, both at the White House and, in Reagan\'s second term,at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as\"indispensable\" to Baker. Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currencysystem and Darman is generally credited by officials of othernations as Baker\'s leading theorist on this issue, favouringtarget zones to limit currency fluctuations. Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasuryunsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system. But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, withDarman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives. Baker\'s work as head of Reagan\'s Economic Policy Council,spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating withthe Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before. Darman\'s strength was not as an economist, but as apolitical strategist \"and that\'s Baker\'s strength too,\" theofficial said. There were already indications that Baker, who throughouthis time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle ofadvisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor. One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould,who holds the number three Treasury position ofUnder-Secretary. Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years. Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was apartner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerlyheaded Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annualmeetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated. He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement,when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britaincurbed the dollar\'s strength. The pact was a major turningpoint in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economiccooperation and intervention in currency markets. Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, likethe Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination ofeconomic policies among the leading industrial countries andthe recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies andstimulate global growth. These policies are collectively aimed at redressing thehuge gap between Japan and West Germany\'s trade surpluses andthe United State\'s massive trade deficit. That policy goal still remains a prime objective of theReagan Administration and will not change with Darman\'sdeparture. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host theinformal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bankchiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in thelight of the February agreement among leading industrialisedcountries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels. In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accordbetween the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britainand Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\" But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have beengrowing since fears of a trade war between the United Statesand Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to arecord low against the surging yen early this week. The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being heldto coordinate the EC\'s positions on monetary issues and ThirdWorld debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week. The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the maindiscussions will take place tomorrow. Continued international currency turbulence could undermineplans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the jointfloat holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuationbands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda. Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period ofcalm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stabledollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to makeit more resilient against exchange rate swings. The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year asthe falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMScurrency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertaketwo major realignments of parities within nine months. In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for awide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMSon the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by theEC\'s Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central BankGovernors. The committees were asked to come up with the proposalsafter the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January. Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, thefledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take overthe mark\'s dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has metwith a cool response in West Germany. He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would reportto the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalisecapital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, suchas the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls. Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements withoutstrengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation inthe Community. He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether memberstates were willing to push further towards the EC\'s goal ofmonetary integration on the basis of an EMS that includedmanagement of exchange rates by some kind of commoninstitution, instead of by national central banks as atpresent. Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen bythe EMS\'s founding fathers, have been thwarted by thereluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove uptheir sovereignty in the monetary field. EMS development has also been held up by Britain\'s refusalso far to join the system\'s core exchange rate mechanism. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last monthafter rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down fromthe previously reported 337,000 rise in February. The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March,1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straightmonths before the March decline. The rise in non-farm payrolls was the smallest since adecline last June of 75,000, the department said. Last month\'s unemployment rate was down from the 7.2 pctlevel in March, 1986. Growth in jobs continued in March but was slower than inrecent months, with the gains concentrated in serviceindustries. The number of goods-producing jobs fell 68,000 in March,while service-producing jobs rose 232,000 to bring the totaljobs in the department\'s survey of businesses to 102.03 mln inMarch. Business and health services showed the largest gains injobs, while manufacturing employment fell by 25,000.

The number of persons working part time for economicreasons fell in March to 5.46 mln from 5.78 mln in February. The loss of factory jobs brought the March total to 19.19mln jobs and was concentrated in automobile, electrical andelectronic manufacturing. Construction employment also lowered the number of jobs inthe goods-producing sector, falling by 45,000 after seasonaladjustment, the department said. Mining employment was little changed in March and has notexperienced any substantial erosion since the rapid job lossesin oil and gas drilling in the first two-thirds of 1986.

{0 'Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may havemore difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off apossible takeover by Henley Group <HENG>, which has accumulatedalmost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroadconglomerate, analysts said. Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henleydisclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, butanalysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover isits intention. Analysts also said the company has strong defenses thatwould easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problemscombining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatorylimbo. Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that SantaFe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cashequivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over25 pct. \"This gives them plenty of borrowing power,\" he said,which could be used against an unwanted suitor. Henley Group\'s Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wantsto take major positions in undervalued natural resourcecompanies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seekingan acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs. Santa Fe officials don\'t appear concerned that Henley mightlaunch a takeover. \"I would not characterize the atmospherearound here as one of concern,\" one Santa Fe executive saidabout Henley. \"I think it\'s wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firmstrategy with Santa Fe,\" said Mark Hassenberg, who coversHenley for DLJ Securities. Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe\'s land assets arelikely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe\'s effortsto merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo,sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeablefuture. These realities, they said, support the Henley Group\'sstatement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment. The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcomingdifficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topekaand Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co.The merger would create the nation\'s second-longest railroad. Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) deniedthe merger on anticompetitive grounds. The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights tofour western railroads to meet the ICC\'s concerns and persuadeit to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle tomerge the lines. \"My guess is the commission will decide in three to sixweeks whether to reopen hearings,\" Fischer said. \"I believe they\'ve made an effort to satisfy the ICC\'sobjections,\" he said. \"But in doing so they haven\'t pleasedeveryone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side,now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are setup.\" If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it willtake six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and upto another year for the ICC to decide. Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buybackprogram begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as ofFebruary 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, aspokesman said. Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned byNorfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 andanother of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said. James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fightoff the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the sharebuybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe\'soptions, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake. \"It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as alow-risk, opportunistic investment,\" Voytko said. \"People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrsto 50 dlrs a share,\" said DLJ Securities\' Hassenberg. \"But I\'mcertain that in Dingman\'s mind, the company is worth more thanthat in breakup value.\" Reuter',1 ACQ}

The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31said active participation in writing world farm trade rules atthe next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.

Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show. The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow toimprove productivity and demand/supply imbalances. The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainlyresponsible for higher domestic prices, it said. The strong yen has meant lower input material prices buthas also resulted in higher agricultural imports which hasworsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the papersaid. This could make it difficult to improve the industry\'sstructure, the paper said.

{0 'Amid new concerns about inflation,interest rate increases and trade confrontations,finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discussa deteriorating global debt and economic situation. The meetings, under the auspices of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates areturning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,upsetting bond and stock markets. Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the globaleconomy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continueto carry the burden of their growing debt without vast newassistance. Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signsany new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury SecretaryJames Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works. The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs ofcommercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded bylaying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans. Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in avisit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out theadministration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses tothe very poorest states. The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministersin detail during next week\'s meetings and will undoubtedly beembraced by the developing countries. \"There\'s interest on the part of some countries for lookingat the support of the special problems of the very poorestcountries, because their position is so extreme,\" a Reaganadministration official said. He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue. The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debtinitiative, which called for new funding to help debtorcountries grow out of their problems. The largest industrial countries have been attempting tocoordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling thedecline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and otherproblems. At the same time, the industrial countries see littleevidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fundforecasts they will grow 2.5 pct. The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked otherindustrial countries to stimulate their economies. These issues directly affect the debt problem and theability of the debtor countries to grow out of theirdifficulties. In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports ofdeveloping country, allowing them to earn critical foreignexchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing othersto import more from developing countries. The discussions, from April six to 10, will bewide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to theimpact of development loans on the environment, according tomonetary sources. The talks will include an examination of tradeprotectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reaganadministration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs onmicrochip products from Japan, the sources said. The move accelerated the dollar\'s decline as financialmarkets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing. There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. chargesthat Japan has been selling computer chip products below fairmarket value and has kept its own market closed to imports,further undermining the international trading system. At the same time, the ministers will discuss thefundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the exportmainstay of many developing countries. The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- theUnited States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- willgather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further. The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada forfurther debate on economic policy coordination. As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such asJapan agreed to stimulate their economies, while Americasaid it would reduce its federal budget deficit. Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to tohave a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, strengthening the link between loans andeconomic policy changes in debtor nations. Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take moreaccount of the environment when making loan for dams and otherprojects. The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said thisissue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganizationplan for the Bank, now being prepared. Reuter',1 TRADE}

At the same time its foreign liabilities rose 100 mln to22.8 billion, producing a rise in net reserves of 200 mln to82.2 billion on March 31. The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourthMarch week by disbursing funds in the money market viagovernment-owned banks. Banks took up the Bundesbank\'s standingoffer of treasury bills to place excess liquidity. Banks received more liquidity through routine month-endpayments by public authorities as well as expansionary marketfactors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cashin circulation to 122.3 billion, the Bundesbank said. But banks had to draw heavily on the Lombard emergencyfinancing facility due to month-end tightness, borrowing 5.3billion marks. Overall, banks\' holdings at the Bundesbank rose 10.2billion marks to 58.5 billion at the end of the month,averaging 50.9 billion in the whole of March.

{0 'Dutch dairy and general foodsmanufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS>, said it isplanning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strongprofit growth over the next 10 years. Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at thepresentation of Wessanen\'s 1986 report he already expected 1987first quarter profits to show an increase. The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985. This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar\'sguilder value, van Driel said. Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guildershigher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985level of 3.20 guilders. Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mlnguilders down because of the lower dollar and lower rawmaterial prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders. US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separatebusinesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide. Van Driel said the company would continue an activetakeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying morethan its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit. He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisitionpossibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China. He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mlnguilders and would if necessary make new share issues. Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mlndlrs. He said <Balanced Foods> and <Green\'s Dairy>, taken overlate last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrswhich was not included in the 1986 account. All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key tothis growth was the successful introduction of new products,which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented USacquisitions, van Driel said. Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said. The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims tobe quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said. Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not beaccompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehiclesfor the company to raise capital for future expansion. He estimated that 33 pct of the company\'s shares were inforeign hands. The company\'s 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made alisting on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,van Driel said without elaborating. Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which producesaround 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospectsfor its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said. REUTER',1 EARN}

{0 'Pakistan is not emerging as a majorwheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to thePakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview. No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so andplans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothingbecause they could not agree a price, he said. Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surplusesof one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next fewharvests in years when the weather is favourable. The government does not wish to increase output much abovethis because of low world prices, and the land would be betterused for other crops. Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sownto wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched tomore profitable crops such as oilseeds. The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from thecurrent 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per haover the next five to seven years, he said. Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which isjust beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mlntonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year\'syield of 14.0 mln. He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but morerecent rains reduced prospects slightly. The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mlntonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan\'s annualpopulation growth rate of more than three pct. Currentconsumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes. The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mlntonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a\"strategic reserve\" target of two mln tonnes. Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes overtarget, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said. The government wants to keep an extra \"safety margin\" untilit sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheatrationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exportswill be considered only in about a year\'s time when the 1987/88crop can be gauged as well, he said. The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for thegovernment to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at tworupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price inPakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo. Under the old system, introduced during World War Two anddue to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards wereissued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply. Aziz said following the introduction of a governmentsupport price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted thatonly 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching theconsumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills. The ration system had also not had the stabilising effecton the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said. Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction ofthe new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensivePakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30. Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have amajor effect on total consumption, but it may encourage betteruse of side-products such as bran. Reuter',1 WHEAT}

In a letter to the West German community here, AmbassadorJoerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought inMoscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and-137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts. Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University,including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, werefound to be free of radiation, it said. Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts containedcaesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by theUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced noparticular health danger as most of the caesium remained in thetea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts. The products sent for testing were bought in state shopsand private farmers\' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Westernembassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratorytesting of Soviet food late last year because no abnormalradiation levels were detected. \"We didn\'t find anything so we stopped doing it,\" a U.S.Embassy spokesman said.

In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,including a number of special items. Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the specialitems and also removing the earnings of American Television andCommunications Corp <ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in1986. Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by thecable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directlyin CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs inTurner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest. Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, aTurner Broadcasting spokesman said. Bigelow said the company is continuing its previouslyannounced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares werepurchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of81 dlrs per share. Bigelow said the company will always have a share buybackprogram in place whenever it believes it is a better long-terminvestment than starting or acquring a business. But he did notgive any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mlnshares already announced. On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman andchief executive said the company is not interested in investingin over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at allareas in which it is currently engaged. Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time.In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggestacquisition ever. N.J.

He said following the recent agreement for the sale ofHarper and Row to the News Corp Ltd <NWS>, \"there may be piecesthat Murdoch doesn\'t want,\" referring to News Corp chairmanRupert Murdoch. Asked if the company\'s SAMI business is for sale, Munrosaid it is a \"delicate subject\", and \"we\'re looking at all theoptions.\" SAMI is a marketing information service for the foodindustry. Published reports have stated it could be worth asmuch as 500 mln dlrs. Bigelow said that Time\'s Home Box Office added subscriberslast year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of1987. However, he said, HBO\'s results in the quarter will bedown slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was aspecial gain in the HBO unit. Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscribergrowth of 800,000 for last year. He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits andhigher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in thetax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points. Munro said the company does not plan to increase itsdividend.
