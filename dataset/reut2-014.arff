{0 'Japan is attempting to cut backsemiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April17, industry analysts said. The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and apossible shortage of the key computer components in the nextfew weeks, the analysts said. \"Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay ofthe Japanese semiconductor industry,\" analyst Drew Peck ofDonaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said. But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,and some questioned whether Japan would be successful inforcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run. Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence wasalready in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and haltedsales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sellchips at below production costs. \"We\'ve seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, andit has virtually dried up for EPROMS,\" said Merrill Lynchanalyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used incomputers. \"Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries arestretching,\" Kurlack added. Industry analysts said Japan\'s Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs inproduction to meet the terms of last year\'s semiconductoraccord with the U.S. The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs onJapanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed tolive up to the accord and continued to dump the computercomponents in the U.S. market. But some analysts said Japan\'s attempt to mollify the U.S.was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form oftrade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, priceswill rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductormanufactures will be able to take up the slack since most longago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makersthat use the chips in their machines will then be pressured. \"The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce tradepressures from Washington, but at the same time they\'redemonstating their muscle,\" analyst Peck said. The cut backs in Japanese production are expected tobenefit U.S. chip makers. \"I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.semiconductor manufacturers,\" industry analyst Elliot Levine ofLadenburg Thalmann Co said. But analyst Peck said, \"it will take a few weeks to seewhether Japan has genuinely cut production.\" He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI\'srequest unfavorably because chip capacity was still high andproduction cut backs would lead to significant write-offs inplant and equipment.

{0 'The use of generic commoditycertificates, or \"certs,\" for fiscal years 1986-88 will savethe government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of AgricultureUndersecretary Daniel Amstutz said. Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on theuse of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 couldresult in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs. However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in netsavings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said. Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly theentire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have beenforfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC. In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have beenredeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges wouldhave remained in the goverment inventory, he said. When asked to comment on a recent study by the GeneralAccounting Office that concluded certificates result in a netcost to the government, Amstutz said, \"GAO underestimated thebenefits and overstated the costs\" of the certificate program. Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loanentries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions ratherthan forfeitures. GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said. \"There is no question in the mind of the Department ofAgriculture that these certificates have been very useful,\"Amstutz said. Immediate benefits of certificates include greater marketliquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farmincome, and improved debt situation and decreased carryingcosts, he said. Certificates are an integral part of USDA\'s long-rangemarket-oriented farm policy, he said. Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep.

{0 'More generic grain certificatesshould be released onto the market in order for the U.S.certificate program to have its full effect on commodities,according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc. The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiencypayments and paid land diversion payments in a two-thirdcertificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told aHouse agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates. Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughlya 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said. The Sparks study on certificates examined two possiblescenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a \"zerocertificate case,\" where no certificate program was assumed,and an alternative case labeled \"adequate certificate case\" inwhich sufficient certificates would be released so that grainprices would not be artificially supported by market shortagesdue to acreage reduction programs or government holdings. The study showed that total grain use under the adequatecertificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenarioby 11.2 pct. Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grainusage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed thezero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct. For the five-year period examined, government expendituresunder the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.

{0 'A group of Canadian lawmakers fromOntario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canadafrom the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a majortrade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress. At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, anorganization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of theOntario Parliament\'s Select Committee on Economic Affairs, saidthe exemption would help trade relations. The trade legislation to be considered by the full House inlate April would require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions wouldharm the U.S. economy. Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on anygrounds. Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.congressmen, \"I can understand (the trade bill). I think it hasto do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world.\" \"I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. Youdo not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerelyconsider exempting our country from that bill,\" he added.

Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not bediscussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow,the Japanese officials said. The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with thisweek\'s International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, willreaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said. Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker earlyin this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates,officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details ofthat discussion. The Japanese officials also declined to detail whatMiyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater jointintervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or onindependent American intervention. The officials said such a money market action to stabilizethe dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which issuffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but alsofor the benefit of the United States as well. As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost itsdomestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explaineconomic measures to the G-7, the officials said. However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of theJapanese economic package in his meeting with Baker todaybecause the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized bythe Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year whichstarted April one, the officials said.

{0 'News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be keyto the direction of currency futures at the InternationalMonetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyondthe Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financialanalysts said. \"If they (the finance ministers) give the market somethingreally new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyondthe Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in thedollar,\" said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills. On the other hand, \"anything neutral would tend to bebearish for the dollar,\" Mills said. Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of theParis accord will not be enough to halt the decline in thedollar, nor will central bank intervention. \"A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currenciesand sell the dollar,\" said one trader for a large retail firmon the floor of the IMM. \"If there is no concrete resolution, they will be lookingto sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level,\" hesaid. Technically, most currency futures are poised for anotherrise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract highon Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while Junesterling set a new contract high on Monday. \"Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and youdon\'t need much to get things rolling,\" Sloane said. In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloanerecently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a rangebetween 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangleon the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside. A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal abreakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearbyCanadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday. Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentialsbetween Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narroweddramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bondsonly about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes. What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is anincreasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into theCanadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors. Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be nearthe top of their long-term rally. \"Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting tocalm people,\" said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.

{0 'Mounting trade friction between theU.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia\'s exportingnations that the row could inflict far-reaching economicdamage, businessmen and officials said. They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in theU.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurtthem in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo\'s loss might betheir gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs onimports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, inretaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to stick to a pact notto sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffsat 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firmssaid they would virtually halt exports of products hit by thenew taxes. \"We wouldn\'t be able to do business,\" said a spokesman forleading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co Ltd <MC.T>. \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of timebeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion ofexports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said TomMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <JamesCapel and Co>. In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried. \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat againstJapan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a seniorTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named. Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs lastyear, 95 pct of it with the U.S. The surplus helped swell Taiwan\'s foreign exchange reservesto 53 billion dlrs, among the world\'s largest. \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers andcut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if wewant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" saidPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group>. A senior official of South Korea\'s trade promotionassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japanmight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exportsare similar to those of Japan. Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billiondlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said toughcurbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers ofsemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to theU.S. In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has beenselling below-cost semiconductors, some electronicsmanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said sucha short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed byfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports. \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry. \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it willbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kongis the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said. The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong\'s biggest export market,accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports. The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of tradetalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday. \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between twocountries which are major trading partners of ours is a veryserious matter,\" Button said. He said Australia\'s concerns centred on coal and beef,Australia\'s two largest exports to Japan and also significantU.S. Exports to that country. Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve thetrade stand-off continue. Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlineda package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.

{0 'Sumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> is certain tolose its status as Japan\'s most profitable bank as a result ofits merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said. Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bankwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, inOctober. But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsutold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain itsposition. \"We\'ll be back in position in first place within threeyears,\" Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduceSumitomo\'s profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expandSumitomo\'s branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area whereit has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and howquickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo inview of the smaller bank\'s large debts. Others argue the mergerwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branchnetwork from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It hasexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities businessand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned thewisdom of some of those moves. \"They\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Nowit\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltdfinancial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo\'s problems are limits placed on its move toenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in Americaninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being atleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchangepersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other. \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because theFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,we can do various things. We only have to wait two or threeyears, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routesinto the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\'sversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercialfrom investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsusaid he hopes further deregulation will create newopportunities. \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In somecases these will be securities related, in some cases trustbank related. That\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\" Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on suchdomestic securities business as profitable government bonddealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities CoLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about enteringthe securities business here through its Swiss universal banksubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo. The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences tosecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,following a similar decision for subsidiaries of Europeanuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similardecision on a Gottardo subsidiary. \"We don\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowedin two or three years,\" he said. Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expandlending to individuals and small and medium businesses toreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot oftime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including themerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. \"It\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" saidKleinwort\'s Smithson. \"After that, it\'s a question of absorbing and jugglingaround. It will be the next decade before we see if thestrategy is right or wrong.\" REUTER',1 ACQ}

Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today asan earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectivelywithdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market withtoday\'s allocation. A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that thewithdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of creditpolicy, but was to be seen in the context of plentifulliquidity in the banking system. Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbankover the first six days of the month, well clear of the likelyApril minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks. The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banksthemselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.

{0 'Kuwait\'s oil-reliant and debt-riddeneconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil priceswill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economistssay. Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to holdoil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in thenorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens. Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of grossdomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last yearafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before. This was after taking into account inflation in consumerprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986. Factors depressing economic activity include the6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\'s doorstep, whichthreatens the emirate\'s vital oil export lifeline through theGulf and has sapped business confidence. But sentiment received a much-needed boost in Septemberwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisiscaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensivenew debt settlement program was introduced. The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forwardtrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default. The cheques were also used as collateral for consumerspending, thus generating an informal credit system. Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums arestill owed by individuals and companies. There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of whichone-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank asbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said itwill not allow any banks to go under. The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling ofproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whetherdebtors have regular cash flows or not. Banks\' shareholders and depositors will have their rightsguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significancein a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sectoris the biggest after oil. Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to rideout the oil glut, bankers and economists say. Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned lastyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah. But strategic diversification into downstream operations inEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment athome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sellover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products. Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processedproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than ascrude. Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reasonfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domesticinflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recentyears and signs government spending on productive sectors willremain steady. External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct belowthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hitGulf. Kuwait\'s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were putofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment incomeof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.

Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB andrepresented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB\'splans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach offiduciary duties.\" The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also beheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, agovernment nominee on the company\'s board. De los Angeles, who represents SMC\'s minority stockholders,asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week bythe company\'s board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of thesequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos pershare. De los Angeles told the SEC the company\'s retainedearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by thepurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration ofdividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violatean SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debtto equity ratio. He quoted SMC\'s chief financial director Ramondel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction wouldboost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earliersuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman AndresSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles\' earlier complaint related to SMC assuminglast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC\'s Hong Kongsubsidiary <Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.The loan assumption was again ratified by last week\'s boardmeeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino toresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report byApril 15. \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part ofa continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregardof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an earlydisposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said ina statement. \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB havereached agreement on the price of the shares and the method ofpayment, this suit is in direct contravention of thegovernment\'s expressed desire to reach an amicable settlementof the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment onCojuangco\'s court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming fromus might be interpreted as adversarial.\" Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel whichsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligibleto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a UnitedStates citizen. The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares,which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares whichare available to foreign buyers. SMC sources said Soriano personally was not amongprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased bythe <A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamedinstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyersin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB. The sale was aborted when Diaz\'s Presidential Commission onGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they wereowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former PresidentFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in theU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividendannounced last June. \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaztold Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\" The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversywould be resolved before the company\'s annual stockholders\'meeting, scheduled for May 14.

{0 'Senate Banking Committee ChairmanWilliam Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introducelegislation shortly to require greater public disclosure ofcorporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders. Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increasedthe chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for moredisclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and wouldinsure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the thresholdfor notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that ainvestor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in acompany to three pct from the current five pct threshold within10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirementthat an investor intended to aquire three pct that would haveto filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant toprevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public inknowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that atender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiringcompany violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmiresaid the legislation would aim at insuring current marginrequirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirementfor purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generallyenforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeoverdeclare that they can raise the capital for a takeover withoutactually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages forfailure to meet the Federal Reserve\'s 50 pct marginrequirements. The bill also would require more disclose when severalinvestors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to knowabout it,\" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britaintowards two-tiered tender offers that insures that allshareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would coverdefensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
