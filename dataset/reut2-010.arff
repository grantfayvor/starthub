In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bankand Financial Analysts\' Association, Heller said, \"I believethat increased diversification along geographic and productlines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.\" He said he supported the idea of financial services holdingcompanies advocated by the Association of Bank HoldingCompanies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiarieswould be handled on functional lines. \"Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by thebank to the associated institutions, and all transactions wouldhave to be on an arms-length basis,\" Heller said. Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks\'special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries. Heller said he \"would require the holding company to serveas a \'source of strength\' to the bank by making a commitment tomaintain the bank\'s capital. \"In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail aslong as the holding company has a positive net worth.\" Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permittedto own a financial services holding company, again with theprovision that capital would flow to the financial enterpriseif necessary. Heller said the effects of these actions \"would be banksthat are at least as strong as the corporations holding them\" inwhich customer deposits were assured while any incentive to\"loot the bank\" was removed. Such diversification would give access to national andinternational financial services to corporations across theUnited States.

U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. ExxonCorp <XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp <CHV> jumped1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco <TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. UnocalCorp <UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp <AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4. Standard Oil\'s stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost itsoffer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained itwould not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid inthe first place indicates that the British oil giant haschanged its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of themore bearish positions on oil prices. \"They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (abarrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hastyretreat from that point of view,\" Margoshes said. \"They are more appropriately today looking moreoptimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe thatwill be exceeded,\" Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate wastrading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buyup the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share whenoil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil\'s brightest asset is its slightlymore than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oilfield. Analysts also said the company has other interests inthe Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremelyattractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market andhas hard-to-replace reserves. \"I think it just fits in with their long-range plans toincrease their position in the U.S. market,\" Dean Witteranalyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP\'s visibility ahead of theBritish government\'s announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BPstock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holdingsometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP\'s reserveswould be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock isheld in the U.S. \"The only way they can sell all that stock is to move itinto the United States. No other market can handle all thatstock,\" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua. In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs onrevenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the yearearlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

Relations between the government and farmers have becomestrained in France in recent months.

{0 'The former chief currencydealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreignexchange speculation in West Germany\'s biggest banking crash,can stand trial for damages, a court ruled. The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a casefor damages should not be allowed after such a long interval. Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mlnmarks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts. The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of overone billion marks stunned West Germany\'s business community,and led to a tightening of banking regulations. The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marksannounced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud incurrency transactions. Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when itcollapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bankwere jailed in 1983.

{0 'The Soviet economy has grown at anincreased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev\'s leadership, but hisgoals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S.intelligence agencies. The report was prepared jointly by the Central IntelligenceAgency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for theCongressional Joint Economic committee, which released it. It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986,Gorbachev\'s first full year in power, twice the average rate ofgrowth over the previous 10 years. Gorbachev\'s policies to improve worker attitudes, removeincompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism andmodernize the country\'s industrial equipment accounted for someof the gains, the report said. \"Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev hasadopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to hisefforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-termsolutions are attributes that his immediate predecessorslacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev\'s program appears too ambitiouson a number of counts,\" the report said. Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Unionsaid Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four yearsif he continues his reform policies. \"I don\'t think he can last four years,\" Marshall Goldman ofHarvard University told a Congressional hearing. \"He\'s moving sofast, he\'s stepping on so many toes.\" A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of theSmithsonian Institution\'s Kennan Institute for Advanced Russianstudies. The economic report said meeting targets for commodityoutput would require unrealistic gains in productivity andindustrial output targets appear too high to allow time toinstall more advanced equipment. None of Gorbachev\'s proposals would change the system ofeconomic incentives that has discouraged innovation andtechnological change, the report added. \"The first significant resistance to specific policies,although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both themassive government and party bureaucracy, particularly amongenterprise managers who complained that they were being askedto carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise qualitystandards and output targets simultaneously,\" the report said. The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in theSoviet economy over the next several years. It said the SovietUnion trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advancedmanufacturing technologies, such as computers andmicroprocessors. Reuter',1 IPI}

The borrowings actuallyaveraged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and thatwas up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period. Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming fortwo-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mlndlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate ofaround 6.10 pct.

{0 'The United States\' emphasis on itsforeign trade deficit is misplaced and the country\'s realproblem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the GeneralAgreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said. By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billiondlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressurewhich threatens the world trading system, it said in an annualreport. The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federalbudget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting governmentspending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pctin 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of theprevious two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism andinstead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the currentaccount payments deficit -- higher private savings, lowerinvestment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers \"would result in little or noreduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,increase inflation and reduce world trade,\" it said. \"The basic cause -- some combination of insufficientdomestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- wouldremain,\" the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this yearbecause of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some WestEuropean nations as they adjust production and workforces to alow dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over ThirdWorld debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts ofJapan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changeswere not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added. \"Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reducedas a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was notborne out last year,\" the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in theU.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidlyexpanding money supply and low dollar. \"Such a development could worsen the business climate byincreasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, inturn, would adversely affect world trade.\" But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to theUnited States, despite the dollar\'s depreciation which makesforeign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both humanand in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce thegoods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATTsaid. Developing countries\' exports declined significantly, whiletheir imports increased moderately, although full statisticsare not available yet, GATT said. The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nationswere sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports. REUTER',1 TRADE}

It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Mathesonachieved the good performance through satisfactory results inmost sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG>,Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan. He said the group\'s stake of about 35 pct in Hong KongLand, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of areorganisation, is \"a long term investment and now stands at alevel which causes us no financial strain or problems of assetimbalance.\" Keswick said the issue of new \"B\" shares will give the group\"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares forexpansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability whichhas been brought about through the group\'s recentrestructuring.\" He said the new issue is pending approval from both thefirm\'s shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriateadjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.

{0 'Philippine sugar production in the1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, SugarRegulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said. Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current millingseason, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimatewould almost certainly be met. He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop wouldbe earmarked for domestic consumption. Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for theU.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market. He said if the government approved a long-standing SRArecommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would takeup another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target. \"The government, for its own reasons, has been delayingapproval of the project, but we expect it to come through byJuly,\" Yulo said. Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oilimport bill by about 300 mln pesos. Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready tostart manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved. The ethanol project would result in employment for about100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work bydepressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry. Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, hadbeen submitted to President Corazon Aquino. \"I think the President would rather wait till the newCongress convenes after the May elections,\" he said. \"But thereis really no need for such quotas. We are right now producingjust slightly over our own consumption level.\" \"The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,\" Yulosaid, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesosper picul, up from 190 pesos last August. Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculationfollowing the SRA\'s bid to control production. \"We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,\"he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned fromtheir mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming andcloth production. He said diversification into products other than ethanolwas also possible within the sugar industry. \"The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,\" Yulo said.\"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but theyrelocated many of them and diversified production. We want tocall this a \'sugarcane industry\' instead of the sugar industry.\" He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, usedfor thatching roofs, or used in room panelling. \"When you cut sugarcane you don\'t even have to producesugar,\" he said. Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of theInternational Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984. \"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a newagreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said. \"If there is no agreement world prices will always bedepressed, particularly because the European Community issubsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.\" He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, whereproduction costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound. \"If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents Iexpect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the endof this year,\" he said. Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by1990, with world consumption outstripping production. He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachmentsfrom artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup. \"But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,\" hesaid. \"Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to theU.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cutours in half without any justification.\" Manila was keenly watching Washington\'s moves to cutdomestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents. The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986. Yulo said despite next year\'s increased production target,some Philippine mills were expected to shut down. \"At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the1986/87 season,\" he said. \"We expect two or three more to followsuit during the next season.\" REUTER',1 SUGAR}

Merrill Lynch and CoInc <MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc <PAC>, both ofthe U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.

Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate againstthe guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.

At the moment, the rates for three month euromark depositstrade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have arate of around 5-7/16 pct.

Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups andwidespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will behard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincidedwith news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surpluslast month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration\'sEconomic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory actionagainst Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a jointtrade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - onedesigned to pep up Japan\'s sagging economy and imports in theshort-term, the other to redirect the country in the mediumterm away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting couldrob both packages of much of their punch and might even preventone from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw upa package of short-term economic measures until after its1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that wouldamount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time forhis trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott byopposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to theU.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his rulingLiberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its ownmeasures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basisof the government\'s plans, without losing face in parliamentover the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government\'s short-term economicpackage said it would probably include interest rate cuts onloans by government corporations, deregulation, measures topass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers inthe form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned forthe entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the firsthalf, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfyReagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American tradedeficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is alsolikely to present Reagan with details of Japan\'s longer-termeconomic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japangovernor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a finalreport outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy daysbefore Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up toMaekawa\'s report last year on economic restructuring and arelikely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas asagricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailedas possible, they said the political realities might force themto water down some of the committee\'s recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economymight look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoesmassive restructuring, officials said. The subcommitteeprojects that the current account surplus will fall to lessthan two pct of Japan\'s total output, or gross nationalproduct, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, whichmeasures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pctof gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth forJapan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradualappreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around1993, from 150 now.

The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China. Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands incurrent activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade whichpreviously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added. Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the SovietUnion in the past few days involved Japanese operators sellingThai origin sugar.

{0 'India is searching for non-communistcountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit andconserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering andelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, areall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State TradingCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). \"The two state trading corporations are free to use theirbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indianexports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding thatprivate firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries thatdepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreignimports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small partof India\'s total trading and are likely to account for lessthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in tradeduring the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India\'s 25.65billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the EasternBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps ofagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crudeoil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to helpnarrow the country\'s large trade deficit, is stillinsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billionin the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries incountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slowgrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promotingcountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were madediscreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannotofficially support bartering. The MMTC\'s recent countertrade deals include iron oreexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. \"MMTC\'s recent global tenders now include a clause thatpreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kindfor goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said,adding that the policy remains flexible. \"We also take into account other factors such as prices atwhich the goods and services are offered to India,\" the tradeofficial said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreigncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigsand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chanceif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the tradesources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Koreanfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mlndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. Reuter',1 TRADE}

{0 'Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F.Porsche AG <PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactoryprofit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower butU.S. Sales anticipated higher. Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic saleswere expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000from 28,670 last year. Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Lastmonth the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86. For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume thisyear to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254,Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit werebased on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, headded. The expected drop in West German sales this year would bethe result of the so-called \"grey market\" for Porsche cars, hesaid. When the dollar was strong against the mark, manyPorsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegalexport to the U.S. Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period. The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a largerpercentage of overall sales this year than before does not poseproblems for profit, the Porsche board said. In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same timePorsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki. Branitzki put Porsche\'s hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mlnmarks. In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-partyorders placed with Porsche\'s engineering research centre inWeissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year forthe first time. Porsche\'s net profit dropped sharply to 75.3 mln marks in1985/86 from 120.4 mln marks in 1984/85. REUTER',1 EARN}

{0 'A final compromise proposal on cocoabuffer stock rules presented by International CocoaOrganization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftlygaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegatessaid. \"We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but westill have some work to do,\" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed ofGhana told Reuters after a producers\' meeting. European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumersaccepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted \"noproblems\" in getting full consumer acceptance. Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreementtoday, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, theysaid. The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases fromnon-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total bufferstock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue hasbeen among the most contentious in the rules negotiations. The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlierproposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegatessaid. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-membercocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted. Another problem area, delegates said, was the question ofprice differentials for different origins of cocoa bought intothe buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager couldfairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered tohim. The compromise narrowed the range of differentials betweenthe origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a movesome delegates described as \"just fiddling.\" But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appeasesome countries that were not satisfied with the originalproposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said. The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on anyday would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate orforward positions, delegates said. If the compromise is accepted by the council, mostconsumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effectnext week, or as soon as practically possible. The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT todiscuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if allparties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meetbefore the council.

In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenuesof 10.7 billion dlrs. Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, DouglasDanforth, Westinghouse\'s chairman, said the company\'s salesgrowth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, \"givenan economic environment that remains on a moderate growthcourse.\" He also said the company will make acquisitions, buthe did not specify particular targets. Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told theanalysts \"our plans do not call for a multibillion dlracquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one.Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisitionthat has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we willconsider it.\" He said the company would consider an acquisitioncandidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse\'sprimiary businesses. Danforth said the corportation was focused in several keyareas including defense electronics, financial services,broadcasting, electrical products and services for constructionand industrial and utility markets. Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse\'s sales to growfaster than the markets the corportation serves and \"surelyfaster than GNP.\" He said earnings per share growth is expected toconsistently exceed the Standard and Poor\'s 500 index andreturn on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range. Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance,told the analysts \"we will consider buying back stock\" butthere are no current plans for such a buyback. Yochum said that at the company\'s current level of earningsit could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and thatWestinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholdervalue. Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrsrestructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation,assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the companyspent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in1988.

{0 'The British government may revoke thelicences of selected Japanese banks and securities companiesoperating in London\'s financial City when they come up forrenewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening upJapan\'s markets to foreign competition, government sourcessaid. \"We can\'t say \"yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)\"but this is definitely being considered,\" an official said. His comments came after the government was formally urgedtoday by a cross-section of influential MPs to take jointretaliatory action with the United States against Japan. Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanesetrade practices. \"There\'s a sense of urgency here now, but theemphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests inJapan,\" another government official told Reuters. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday thatBritain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in theFinancial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliateagainst countries that do not offer reciprocal market access. She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said. The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7billion stg, official figures show. A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged theU.K. Government to \"coordinate action with the President of theUnited States, and through the Department of Trade andIndustry, to suspend all further applications from Japanesecommunications companies for equipment approval by the BritishApprovals Board for Telecommunications, and all furtherapplications from Japanese financial institutions for licences\"until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called\"restrictive conditions\" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)(cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake inJapan\'s international telecommunications market. The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-sectionof MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure onthe Conservative government to take firm action. Officials said another option now being considered by theU.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japaneseinstitutions. That could be done under the government\'sproposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament. 58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to dealin London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-basedfirms are authorised to do financial business, officials said. The new financial services and banking acts offer Britainan alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise deniedunder legally-binding international trade agreements. \"The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and IndustrySecretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging ininvestment, banking and insurance,\" one official said. \"This point has been made to the Japanese at official levela number times,\" the official added. Britain and France are now working together to urge thatthe European Community take collective action against Japan,but by working within EC treaties, another official said. British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radiointerview that the European Community should build barriersagainst Japanese imports through certification proceduressimilar to those facing European exporters in Japan. \"There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,\" hesaid, adding \"(such barriers) can\'t be put in place overnight.\"Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade\"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have afair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which isitself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of ourown domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.\" The situation is only likely to worsen following news thatJapan\'s trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by morethan 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrsfrom 5.7 billion in January, political sources said. But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visibletrade and access to financial markets should be kept separate. Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financialinstitutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, ratherthan larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a globalbusiness centre, government sources said. Japan\'s four largestsecurities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange. In Washington, White House officials said President Reaganwas ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan forbreaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States. There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act onthe recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curbJapanese exports to the United States but officials said themove could come today or early next week. Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reaganincluded tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports whichuse semiconductors. REUTER',1 TRADE}

{0 'U.S. cotton farmers are likely toplant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on anaverage of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearingup for the U.S. Agriculture Department\'s 1987 plantingintentions report next Tuesday. The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpseof what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, whichbegins August 1. Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to10.9 mln acres. On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cottonfarmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres. Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acreshad been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln. Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year\'s gooddemand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analystssaid those factors make cotton a profitable crop. \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there isgoing to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of CargillInvestor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cottonmarket specialists. Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead toincreased acreage, analysts said. They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmerswho used part of their crop as collateral for government loanswere not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton ingovernment warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the governmentwill not pick up the tab for storage. Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers fromparticipating in the program, which could result in morecotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of25 pct of a farmer\'s base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman ofShearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not toparticipate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have. Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yieldingWestern states would be most likely to steer clear of theprogram. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" saidone commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in parton forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during itsannual meeting in late January. But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers havedecided they should be in the program for security reasons.There\'s a lot of comfort in knowing you\'ll be guaranteed thegovernment\'s loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside theprogram is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said WalterBrown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer. Some cotton specialists said their expectations forincreased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday\'s plantingintentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now isbased on information they gathered before their cotton programwas announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She saidtraders will get a better idea of next year\'s cotton outputwhen the USDA\'s planted acreage report is released on July 9. Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don\'t thinkplanted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonmentrate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreageharvested. Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\"at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producingstates. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said. Reuter',1 COTTON}

{0 'Latest consumer price data indicateU.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will beabove last year\'s pace, economists said. \"Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this timelast year, but it\'s not building up a large head of steam,\"said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer priceindex for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,which fired January\'s data with a three pct rise, advanced amore moderate 1.9 pct last month. The CPI came within the range of economists\' expectationsand had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets. Among the key components of the report, transportationprices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gainreflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels anddeclines in new car prices and finance charges. \"There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,\"said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Economists said the latest CPI supports existingexpectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987. The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.Without last year\'s energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct. Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as aresult of the dollar\'s drop as well as the volatile energycomponent warrant attention in case gains in these areas becomefactored into the wider economic picture. \"As long as those price rises do not become entrenched incost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thusreducing international competitiveness, then the FederalReserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pctinflation,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G.

{0 'The London Metal Exchange\'s, LME,decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is apositive move, physical traders and LME dealers said. Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimumpurity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1,1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pctcontract. This is the LME\'s first dollar contract and non-Europeandelivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking atSingapore as a delivery point for other contracts. Trade sources said the LME\'s new contract will conform withexisting industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-meltmaterial, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded. The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positivemove by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian andJapanese traders, who would be able to place metal on towarrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said. Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simplerwith a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almostexclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to bedone during the sterling rings, they added. LME ring dealers said the new contract would match moreclosely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of therecent wide backwardations. Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pctpurity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloccountries, such as Romania. The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declinedas an exporter recently, they said. Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer fromliquidity problems initially, as business may continue tocentre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, wherethere are many holders of large short positions on the LME. But others said the new contract would soon attract tradinginterest, given that much 99.70 metal has already beenattracted to the LME\'s warehouses by backwardations. The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for anew contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, wherehigh grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, theysaid. Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract willeventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Likestandard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the processin this case may take longer, they added. Forming a new contract and establishing a Singaporewarehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,which make physical trading difficult, would not totallydisappear as a result, the trade sources said. These premiums for prompt metal have become asemi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increasedbusiness and volatility in traded options, and are presentlyaround 50 stg. Increasingly large granting of option positions has beentaking place. When some of these are declared and exercised atthe end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezesaround these dates are commonplace, they said. Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Easternoperators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead ofhaving to cover. But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, eventhough the LME\'s new option contracts widen the gap between thedeclaration and prompt dates. These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of themonth, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th. Backwardations will remain while operators continue togrant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceedsaluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said. Reuter',1 ALUM}

The department had earlier reported that real earnings fell0.3 pct in January but revised the figure to show earningsunchanged. Between February this year and February, 1986, realearnings rose 0.5 pct, the department said.

{0 'Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financialofficials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchangecontrols and study the possibility of suspending the controls,a cabinet statement said. The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy andCentral Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduceTaiwan\'s surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached arecord 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month. Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministryand the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to easethe controls, but he did not give details. Yu said the government could maintain the framework of theforeign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. Thecontrols would be used during emergency. Taiwan\'s reserves have resulted largely from its tradesurplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billionin 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan\'s tradewith the United States, according to official figures. But he said that while easing the controls would helpreduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in ashort time. Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted fromgrowing pressure from the United States, Taiwan\'s largesttrading partner, which buys almost half the island\'s exports. Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, toldReuters: \"The decision came a little bit late. But it was betterthan never.\" Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, saidthe government should rapidly relax its foreign exchangecontrols and open its market wider to help balance trade withits trading partners, especially the United States. \"The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchangecontrols will not only help our trading partners, but also helpour own economic problems,\" he said.

Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation forwhat is sees as Japan\'s failure to comply with the terms of thepact. The agreement, struck late last year after months of heatednegotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chipson world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makersto slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateralorganisation designed to promote chip imports. Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged threemln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation andexpressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join. \"This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers maynot be really interested in participating in the Japanesemarket,\" he said.

Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the InterarabCambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached lastmonth among major industrial nations to steady the dollararound current levels left many questions unanswered. \"I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in thedollar,\" Viermetz said. \"I believe there is room for a furtherfall of five to 10 per cent in 1987.\" The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, GreatBritain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late Februaryto stabilise major currencies around current levels. The accord came after months of transatlantic argument,with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington\'s policy of talking thedollar lower had made life impossible for West German andJapanese exporters. The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continuedslide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York inSeptember 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress thevalue of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances. But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty\'s economic models showedthat with no further change in exchange rates -- and continuedsluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Tradedeficit would improve only temporarily. He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs thisyear from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160billion dlrs. \"This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authoritiesand politicians in Washington,\" he said. Viermetz said it was only natural that markets shouldattempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struckwhen the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen. Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or\"Plaza Accord,\" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240yen. Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted tosee the dollar hold within a \"loose range\" of 1.75 to 1.90 marksand 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currencylower being countered by central bank intervention. The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks. Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal fundsrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking anuncontrolled fall in the dollar. But at the same time, worries about the international debtcrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.

While expressing regret over America\'s decision to imposetariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone saidTokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washingtonto help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal requestnext week for emergency talks and that the two sides wouldprobably meet the week after, just days before the April 17deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japaninvestigation of American claims that Japanese companies aredumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronicgoods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo\'s failure tolive up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months ofheated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-pricechips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone\'s comments seemed distinctly more conciliatorythan those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,who earlier today said Japan was ready to take \"appropriatemeasures\" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura\'sremark and said that his main message was that the two sidesneed to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking theUnited States to GATT, the Geneva-based internationalorganization which polices world trade, if Washington imposedthe tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theysaid. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panelto consider the legality of the U.S. Action. But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. \"Itmay be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the UnitedStates may lift its decision at an early date,\" Tamura said. In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, PresidentRonald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he hadevidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in worldmarkets and had opened up its own market to imports. Japanese government officials said they are confident theycan make the pact work. They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chipsthrough unregulated distributors has all but dried up afterMITI instructed domestic makers to cut output. While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japaneseimports of American chips, MITI officials said that theministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens. The Ministry recently called on Japan\'s major chip users,some of whom are also leading producers, to step up theirpurchases of foreign semiconductors.

The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabiaand the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oilprices made possible by last December\'s OPEC accord to restrainoverall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eightdollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery inthe economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expectedgrowth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\"the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higherbudget deficits this year because of needs arising from pastrecession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would riseto 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states\' combinedtrade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in1985.

{0 'A senior Nicaraguan official said arecent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politicallydisastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries. Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuencawas in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)executive board producer members after a meeting last weekendin Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers todiscuss the fall in coffee prices. London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February. Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failedto agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results onLatin America, both economically and politically. He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers topave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September. Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices underan International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year agowhen prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil. Central American economic ministers have estimated theregion will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,Martinez said. He said ICO quota talks broke down last month becauseconsumer members lack the political will to fully supportcommodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate toproducers.

On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo\'salleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact. That agreement, reached last year after heatednegotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chipsin world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors. Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate thefall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s planned trip to Washington at theend of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make surethe chip pact is working, the government is studying measuresit can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensurethe trip\'s success, they said. \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\"one official told Reuters. \"We would very much like to dosomething to respond to that.\" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute fromspreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict theU.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductormakers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and anangry American Congress, the Japanese government has beenforced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductordispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan\'s largestchip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as thedraconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to theannouncement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficultiesthe government faces in taking further action. \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with theU.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of theElectronic Industries Association of Japan. He accused the U.S. Of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S.Action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\" Saba\'s comments contrasted with those of Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the disputethrough consultations. Japan is expected to send a high-level official toWashington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not togo ahead with the tariffs on April 17. Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industryplans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a jointinvestigation into Washington\'s allegations of chip dumping. REUTER',1 TRADE}

But total operating and extraordinary profits, includingearnings from currency and securities trading on the bank\'s ownaccount and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,were more than double the previous year\'s level, AMB said. BfG\'s 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB\'scapital increase, which is to finance the insurance company\'sacquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG. Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid anunchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred anunchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,<Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from whichAMB has acquired the majority stake. The bank has said its business last year suffered from theturbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housingconcern Neue Heimat. AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG\'s business volume to50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus. The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in theinterest margin to 1.9 pct. A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this. The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step uprisk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasisedbecause of the continuing difficulties of some countries. Disclosed risk provisions, which under West Germanaccounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln. BfG\'s parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in1986 from 33.51 billion.

He said frequent but light falls in the areas that areshort of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only needabout three days of the region\'s heavy tropical rains torestore normal moisture to the cane. But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucialto the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said. \"It\'s certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but itmight be in a month without some good falls,\" he said.

Indonesia was badly hit by last year\'s steep plunge incrude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half. But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as tellingPresident Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct inthe financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct theprevious year. Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,although he did not give complete figures. The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to generalelections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,palm oil, tin, timber and coffee. Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of theappreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark againstthe dollar, which increased Indonesia\'s debt repayments. He said the economy would have suffered more from the worldeconomic recession if the government had not devalued therupiah by 31 pct last September. In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Postsaid the government must press ahead with measures toderegulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports. The English-language daily said bigger export earnings wereneeded to finance not only imports but also the country\'sgrowing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs. \"About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall duewithin the next three to five years and will steadily increasethe debt servicing burden,\" the paper said.

The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., Inretaliation for Japan\'s alleged failure to keep a pact on themicrochip trade signed last September. A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters \"Japan has donewhat it can, and now we must persuade the United States to waitfor those steps to take effect.\" The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the Septemberagreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost innon-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17. Analysts noted Japan\'s Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cutproduction in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold inthird countries at non-regulated prices. \"I\'m not sure MITI can do much more than it has,\" saidJardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to callfor production cuts beyond those already sought, although itwould continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods. Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said theywould consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a MatsushitaElectric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase inimports was not likely. Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit ifthe United States did implement the tariffs, which would belevied on consumer electronics products rather than onmicrochips themselves. \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,\"said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to bestopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will bedelayed for another year,\" he said. Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry bystepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japanfor semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here. \"The American approach is full of contradictions,\" JardineFleming\'s Edwards said. \"If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing theywant to do is hit the makers of the final products because thathurts the final market,\" Edwards said. But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but alsofrustration with Japan\'s vast trade surplus. Some analystsargued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may haveto take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact. Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,said \"The major overall issue is to stimulate the domesticeconomy and move away from an export-dependent economy.\" REUTER',1 TRADE}

The unusual situation on the crude oil market last yearalso produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector andforced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.

Inthe parent company, the positive earnings developmentcontinued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover wasbalanced out by increased capacity use and price declines inraw materials.

{0 'Bahrain is introducing a new domesticmoney market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred onthe island\'s newly launched treasury bill programme. The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to allcommercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 whichgives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements intreasury bills, or through discounting them. The circular, released officially to Reuters, said currentarrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer bevalid except \"in quite exceptional circumstances.\" Under the current system, the agency provides the island\'s20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-termswaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-termloans secured against government development bonds. \"The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replacethese operations with short-term assistance based on Governmentof Bahrain treasury bills,\" the circular to banks states. The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with asimultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at ahigher price which will reflect an interest charge. The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements willnormally be for a period of seven days. Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has sinceraised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme. Bahrain\'s commercial banks are currently liquid and havebeen making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offeredby the agency. But banking sources said the new regime fromApril 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasurybills in case they need funds from the central bank. Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks holdtreasury bills, although the need by others to take up papercould increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allottedyields slightly. Last week\'s yield was six pct, although the programme hadstarted at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct. Banking sources said the cost of liquidity throughrepurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollarswaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity wouldforesake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlyingtreasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years oldwould undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close aspossible to the trunk\'s base and cutting off the top of thetree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded treesmature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos perhectare from the sixth year when they begin producing. About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora. Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, whichcauses leaves to fall off, De Mel said. Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees. De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as earlyas in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986that it became widespread. The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how manytrees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will besprayed and remain under observation. T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government\'s Rubber ControllerDepartment, which monitors the industry, told Reutersreplanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken beforelate May when the monsoon rains begin. De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptibleto corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned. The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreignclones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058. Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced byPB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102. These six varieties would also be used to replace treesuprooted or base-budded, De Mel said. Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees perhectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge. \"But no compensation is contemplated at the moment,\" headded. De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control thespread of the disease. \"The drought has not stopped the disease, but probablyhelped in some way because trees have not been affected inareas that are dry,\" he said.

Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had becomean accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk andhad grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, includinga new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30billion U.S. Dlrs.

{0 'The buffer stock rules agreement reachedon Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is animprovement on previous arrangements but the price-supportmechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoaprices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers ofthe 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said theaccord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surplusesoverhanging the market will pull prices down again before long. \"If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt itwill do anything more than stop the price from falling further,and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolateprices,\" a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying,or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the marketis relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction couldpressure prices dramatically, dealers said. The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO,into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold tomanoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January butdelegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stockmanager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next threeweeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producingcountries and assessing the market, since prices are below the\"must-buy\" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonnespecified in the agreement, the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach willbe more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and abuying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes ofwhich are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture MinisterDenis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance ofstabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world\'s largest cocoaproducer. \"We have established rules which will permit us to withdrawimmediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,\" Bra Kanontold reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckonedthe world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However, some producer and consumer members emerged fromthe final ICCO council meeting with reservations about thepact. Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world\'s mostexpensive and provides 60 pct of the country\'s export earnings,made a formal protest to the council about the pricedifferentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too highfor Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of WestGermany, \"Consumers weren\'t perfectly happy with the bufferstock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...Therewere no real winners or losers.\" Some European Community delegates were not satisfied thatimportant points were fully discussed during the talks, and asa result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses aseffectively as they could have, delegates said. Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seekoffers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials toreflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can compriseup to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg pertonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stgin January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council sessiondecides market conditions warrant it, according to theagreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fallbelow the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than fivedays and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity hasbeen filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at anexecutive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said. REUTER',1 COCOA}

The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serveclients in the region and educate financial markets about theadvantages of currency options, Giordano said. Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour byexchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of theexchange-trade currency option market against existingover-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had becomean accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk andhad grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, includinga new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with theperformance of its Australian dollar contract, which since itsintroduction last year had regularly topped the French franc asthe third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000contracts traded daily. Having the Philadelphia exchange open during theAsia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increasearbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuriesaccess to a currency option market of much greater depth andliquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate thefall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone\'s planned trip to Washington at theend of April. While Japan has already done about all it can to make surethe chip pact is working, the government is studying measuresit can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensurethe trip\'s success, they said. \"The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,\"one official told Reuters. \"We would very much like to dosomething to respond to that.\" In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute fromspreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict theU.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductormakers, not to the government. Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and anangry American Congress, the Japanese government has beenforced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductordispute, trade analysts said. They said that it was an open secret that Japan\'s largestchip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as thedraconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,included enforced production cuts. The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to theannouncement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficultiesthe government faces in taking further action. \"Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with theU.S./Japan agreement,\" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of theElectronic Industries Association of Japan. He accused the U.S. of being \"irrational.\" He said the U.S.action had made the bilateral chip pact \"meaningless.\" Saba\'s comments contrasted with those of Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the disputethrough consultations. Japan is expected to send a high-level official toWashington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not togo ahead with the tariffs on April 17. Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industryplans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a jointinvestigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping. Reuter',1 TRADE}
{0 'In a bid to hasten Japan\'s promiseto speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreigntrade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaledtheir tolerance of a lower dollar. Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides,Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was notarget for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaringagainst the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention. \"That was no slip of the tongue,\" said one western monetaryofficial, who asked not to be identified. For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japaneseofficials said late last week a package to bolster domesticdemand will be ready in early April. Until last week, therewere few indications the package would be ready anytime soon. The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congressover the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billiondlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results fromJapan, dramatic action is required. Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs oncertain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhereto a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries. The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appeasemounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes justtwo weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to reviewthe Paris agreement to stabilize currencies. And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr tradesurplus in the first two months this year just underscored theneed for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials. Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in thedeficit. \"I\'d be stunned if we were not going to derive somebenefits (from the lower dollar) soon,\" said one. In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperateclosely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting\"underlying economic fundamentals\" or economic reality. The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japanand West Germany stimulating their economies and the UnitedStates cutting its budget deficit. The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,agree these policies are essential to redress huge global tradeimbalances. But analysts say markets have signalled the underlyingfundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one. Markets, in effect, are less confident than governmentsthat these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cutsagreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out. Nonetheless, the dollar\'s sharp fall has not undermined cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was ontrack and Tokyo and Bonn seem \"to want more stimulative measureswhich is what the Paris accord calls for.\" International monetary sources said exchange marketdevelopments generally have not unsettled policymakers,although Japan is an obvious exception. \"Everybody feels it canstill be managed,\" one source said of market developments. But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated fivebillion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and othercentral banks about one billion dlrs. Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America\'shalf-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting theParis accord outright. The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economicpolicymaking, said Japan\'s understanding of the accord was thatthe yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level itstood at when the accord was struck. The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington\'suse of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a\"pointed reminder\" to Japan to do something about the tradeissues, the source said of the dollar\'s fall against the yen. By departing last Sunday from the language of the Parisaccord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stabilityaround current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar. Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target forthe dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up totheir international responsibilities and stimulate growth.

The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a lowof 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New Yorkfinish, then recovered to 96.20-22. Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investmenttrusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on theforeign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit\'stumble, securities house dealers said. They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cashpositions resulting from their dollar sales today, and aresidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interestrates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currencytrader said. The dollar\'s plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds willfurther promote diversification into other foreign investments,as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stockmarkets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managerssaid. They said major Japanese investors in the past two yearsare estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreignportfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S.Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct. Since late last year, Japanese investors, seekingsubstantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used freshfunds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after theParis currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds andgilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, themanagers said. Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowedinto local bond and stock markets as well. The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a recordlow of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish andcompared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit. The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points formore than a month here, suggesting most dealers could notsatisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said. A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts inU.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo\'s stock market.The stock market\'s bullishness late last week was partly due tofunds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said. Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the firsthalf of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared withaverage monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of1986, Finance Ministry sources said. The steep fall is due to Japanese investors\' cool attitudetowards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct oftotal foreign securities purchased, securities houses managerssaid. Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed therecord high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said. \"Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and wehave bought bonds in currencies such as marks, the Canadiandollar, the ECU and French franc,\" a fund manager at <YasudaTrust and Banking Co Ltd> said.

{0 'Chances that the International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agreeto resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICOdelegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries areready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side thatreopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight dayswhen producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. \"Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions,it\'s difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,\"Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must benegotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotasbut that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lowerits export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegatessaid. At this week\'s March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICOboard is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, thereintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and someadministrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president JorioDauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum andchief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending themeeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be anon-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. \"I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking amongproducers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposalby September (the next scheduled council meeting),\" BronwynCurtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that adate will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect thecoffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for theremainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largestcoffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one anotherfor sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for sharesto be redistributed using \"objective criteria,\" which would havethreatened Brazil\'s share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers,Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put theirobjections as members of the group of eight ICO \"dissident\"producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline inprices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro MartinezCuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to briefproducers on the Managua meeting. However, other producers said they were not aware of thismove toward producer solidarity.

{0 'The U.S. Congress is making Japan,with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of theU.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn aroundAmerica\'s record trade deficit. \"Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: thechallenge to our high technology industries, the threat ofgovernment nutured competition, and the multitude of barriersto our exports,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said. \"If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over tradeproblems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,\"the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committeehearing on the trade bill. Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, havemade trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-rangingbill is being readied for probable House approval next month. Japan\'s bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrsin 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January. Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. tradedeficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance tothe dollar\'s decline in world currency markets as a reason topress Japan to buy more U.S. goods. They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deteriorationin U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology. In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced heintended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japaneseelectronic goods in retaliation for Japan\'s failure to abide bya 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement. Congress also has been been angered by the administration\'slack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issuesincluding beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunicationsgoods, and financial services. The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week infour committees. It is a package of trade sanctions andmeasures to force the administration take tough action againstforeign trade barriers and unfair competition. Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in manycases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japaneseproducts or make them more expensive with higher duties. The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the HouseWays and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is toforce President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreigncompetition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to wintemporary relief from surges in imports. The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrictimports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do notbuy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirantfrom Missouri, has the support of Wright and other keyDemocrats to press for passage of the amendment. The measure would have the most impact on Japan, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, doesnot reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States wouldset import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten percent a year for three years. \"I\'m tired of going into companies and having managers sayto me, \'We\'re not over competing in Japan because we can\'tcompete in the marketplace.\' That argument needs to be takenaway from American business,\" Gephardt said. The administration has said it could not support a tradebill containing such a provision.',1 TRADE}

{0 'The Brazilian Coffee Institute,IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system whenit reopens export registrations, probably later this week,exporters said. They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leavethe basic formula for the minimum registration price unchangedbut raise the contribution quota to partially offset theeffects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations wereclosed in mid-February. To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have tobe around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed. However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contributionquota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, theexporters said. They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contributionquota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnetfunds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteedproducer price. Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide morefunds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds lastweek, funds are still being released for subsequent approval. The sources said it is still unclear when registrationswill be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end ofthis week. \"Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentionsknow. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanentlyclosed down,\" one exporter said. However, before announcing its export policy the IBC islikely to wait to see if tomorrow\'s meeting of theInternational Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board inLondon decides to call a full council meeting to discussreintroduction of export quotas, sources said. There is also talk of the announcement this week of newmeasures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could beawaiting clarification before making any move, the exporterssaid. Another factor which could be delaying the opening ofregistrations is the current strike by bank workers which,while not affecting current shipments, could affectdocumentation and currency operations for new sales. This would certainly be the case if the IBC was consideringobliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two orthree days of registering a sale.',1 COFFEE}
