{0 'World Bank President Barber Conableexpressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of anew showdown between the United States and Japan, might spreadthroughout the industrial world. But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the actionby the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronicgoods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for afull-scale trade war. Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developingcountries to open their markets, arguing that a free tradingenvironment increased the possibility of global economicgrowth. \"We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to manycountries in the developing world which have encouraged theopening of their markets and we want to be sure that thedeveloped world doesn\'t close at the same time,\" he said. He said the U.S. action against Japan was \"a significantretaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change intrade policy.\" The interview came just before next week\'s semi-annualmeetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Referring to Brazil\'s recent interest payments moratorium,Conable also said the global debt situation was very seriousand must be closely watched. He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated onmaking loans that assist the basic underpinnings in thedeveloping world such as dams, roads and sewers, willincreasingly make assistance available for economic reform. The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of thedebt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of newfunds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reformsaimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investmentand reducing government\'s role in the economy. \"We\'re comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,\"Conable said. He made clear, however, that adjustment lending wouldcontinue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lendingfor some time. He noted, \"the problem of debt was a severe one and manycountries are asking for adjustment assistance because of theproblem of debt.\" Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New Yorkchosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. Heis an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launchedthe U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending bythe World Bank. Conable also said that he expected the result of a majorstudy of the Bank\'s organization to be completed in the nextseveral weeks. He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, inpart, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from thepoorest countries for not doing enough to help and from therichest countries because of inefficiency. the reorganization is considered a major initiative byConable, and is being closely-watched by the agency\'s 151member-countries as an indication of his management style andpriorities. \"I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those whomust support it as soundly constituted so that it will bepermitted to grow,\" Conable said. However, he said \"I don\'t believe there is anythingbasically wrong with this institution and I don\'t believe ithas to have any redefinition of its purpose.\" He said, however, that it was apparent that the debtinitiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central rolein dealing with the debt crisis. Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and itssister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good andthat he talked often with IMF Managing Director MichelCamdessus on a variety of issues. On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a needto put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that \"I don\'t havea particular mission here except to be useful to theinstitution and to the process of development.\" He added, \"so I don\'t feel a great calling to personalizethe institution.\" On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable saidthat the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assistingthe region, noting that half of the recently agreed financingof 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank\'s International DevelopmentAssociation was earmarked for Africa. Leading industrial nations are expected to consider newforms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like thosein the Sub-Sahara, during next week\'s meetings. Reuter',1 TRADE}

{0 'A steep drop in goods-producing jobsdetracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makesit unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetarypolicy to defend the dollar, economists said. U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, lessthan the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial marketsexpected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared withFebruary\'s 50,000 gain, while March construction employmentdropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February. \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as weend the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanleyand Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth inthe second and third quarters.\" \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\"he said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, butclearly they can\'t tighten.\" David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downwardrevision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarterwere weaker than expected. While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the Marchjobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quartergrowth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct. Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the averagemonthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986. \"There\'s momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobswere subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fedtightening for exchange-related purposes.\" In March, the average workweek fell back to its Januarylevel of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturinghours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February. The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturingjobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted fornearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs. Economists said that a build-up in auto inventoriesresulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up withthe labor force and may point to slower growth ahead. Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as fivepct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales inthe first-quarter GNP accounts. Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise twopct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in thesecond and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrialactivity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinatecontribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\" Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gainsin industrial production and personal income for March.They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, forthese indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pctin industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income. Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the dropin March construction employment may also signal a drop inMarch housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units inJanuary. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest levelsince March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointedout that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February. \"This just means that there were fewer people looking forwork, so the drop in unemployment doesn\'t mean much,\" he said. He said the latest employment report will not concern theFed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can\'t afford to tightento quickly either.\" The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonalfluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March laborforce gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated themin January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent withhis forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth. Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not thinkthat the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at theirmeeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined toease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the Marchemployment report \"increases the likelihood they won\'t tighten,regardless of the dollar.\" Reuter',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'The Securities and ExchangeCommission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering forthe shares of companies that they must extend the period theiroffers are open if key conditions are changed. Specifically, the agency said those making tender offersfor companies\' stock must extend the offers if they decide toeliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to betendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the sharesthat were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules, which officials saidclarifies the SEC\'s present position, the agency said a tenderoffer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum sharecondition is a \"material change\" of the tender offer under U.S.securities law, SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific materialchanges, such as changes in the percentage of securities beingsought or the price being offered, made during the course of atender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension, which is aimed at givingshareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tenderoffer, was not specified in cases where the minimum shareconditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in suchcases would depend on the facts and circumstances surroundingeach case, but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waiversof a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of eachoffer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the newinformation. Officials declined to identify the two offers. \"If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end ofits offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequatedissemination,\" the SEC said.

{0 'U.S. scientists said some tropicalvegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is atrisk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight toa campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) forlabelling changes. The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied byMalaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palmkernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raiseblood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel andcoconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on foodmanufacturers\' labels. The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it wouldconsider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealingwith cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods. Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASAthat palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol andcontributes to heart disease are untrue. But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at RutgersUniversity, said, \"Palm oil is definitely not good for humanhealth because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid.\" He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater theblood cholesterol level. \"It has been well established thathigh cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heartdisease,\" he said. A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, BorgeBek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil ischolesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancerproperties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteriesin humans. Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fatsdaily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than frompalm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E. David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the WistarInstitute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view onlabelling. \"What people really have to learn is to read labels,\"said Kritchevsky. \"The more a consumer knows, the more likely hewill make an intelligent choice.\" The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm,palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels. Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, \"Moresaturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from thatpoint of view it\'s a health risk. High cholesterol levels inthe blood are a risk factor for heart disease.\" Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S.Agriculture Department\'s Food and Consumer Services Division,said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils withhigh saturated fat levels was highest among those who haveheart disease.

{0 'Firmer crude oil prices, government aidpackages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada\'s oilindustry recover from last year sharp downturn, industryanalysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987compared to last year\'s dismal results when oil prices droppedabout 50 pct. On Canada\'s stock exchanges, energy shares have soared totheir highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading atrecord highs. \"This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on thepart of the investment community that the outlook for theindustry for the future is extremely attractive,\" Peters and CoLtd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada\'s major oil companies,culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd\'s 2.20 billion Canadian dlr1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of lastyear\'s results, analysts said. \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and arecording of history. The stock market is the indication of thefuture,\" Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange\'s oil and gas index of 41companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15at the end of 1986. Among Canada\'s largest oil companies, class A shares ofImperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, istrading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.Texaco Canada Inc <TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX>, isat 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecastsoperating profit for 10 of Canada\'s largest oil and gascompanies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrsand operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billiondlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs abarrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increasewith cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said. \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of theprofit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\"he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, whenoperating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn\'t think oil prices will holdrecent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director HansMaciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crudeoil supply outweighing demand and doesn\'t believe a recent OPECproduction accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industryoutlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecastimproved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued thisweek, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. \"The industry\'s outlook for 1987 is positive, but notrobust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report. \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there isgood reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies havepared 1987 spending plans from last year\'s lower levels,deferring most frontier exploration work. \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments,very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\"Canadian Petroleum Association\'s Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushionthe industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when thefederal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oilcompanies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flowdecline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented furtherexploration spending cuts, analysts said. \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutelynecessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments thatwere made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerablymore,\" Maciej said.

The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allowmechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels asthe species from which it was derived. For example, \"pork\" would be listed on the ingredientsstatement instead of \"mechanically separated pork.\" Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat productwould have to be stated on the label and the mechanicallyseparated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meatand poultry portion of the product. Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-costproduct that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said. Current regulations allow use of mechanically separatedingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultryproduct, but require it to be listed in the ingredientstatement as \"mechanically separated (species),\" USDA said. USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoidusing mechanically separated meat in their products because theterm carries an \"unwarranted negative connotation\" in the mindsof many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similarregulation exists for poultry products. Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcassparts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have someremaining meat, into specialized processing equipment. Reuter',1 LIVESTOCK}

{0 'The Federal Open Market Committee atits February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain thethen-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed. The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policydirective which gave greater possibility to firmer rather thaneasier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct Januarythrough March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and noM-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set aseven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March. The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal fundsrate \"reference\" range for policy, as in other recent meetings. At a telephone conference on February 23, committee membersdiscussed the possible implications of the decisions reached inParis for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. Noconclusions were contained in the minutes. In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMCsaid that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, orslightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptabledepending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking intoaccount the strength of the business expansion, developments inforeign exchange markets, progress against inflation, andconditions in domestic and international credit markets.\" The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchangedpolicy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank presidentfavored some tightening of reserve conditions. He noted the strong growth in bank loans in Novemberthrough January and the firm federal funds rate that hadprevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. Healso cited the recent declines in the dollar\'s value. Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potentialfor a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believedthat prompt restraints might avert the need for moresubstantial tightening later. Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMCminutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policyimplementation should be especially alert to the potential needfor some firming of reserve conditions.\" In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserverestraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow inline with current expectations and there were concurrentindications of intensifying inflationary pressures against thebackground of stronger economic data. One indication of potential price pressure might be afurther tendency for the dollar to weaken. The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easingduring the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did notwant to rule out the possibility of some slight easing duringthe inter-meeting period, although they did not view theconditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\" The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in thedollar\'s value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have anysignificant effect on the Fed\'s economic projections. Inaddition, they anticipated that considerable progress would bemade in reducing the federal budget deficit. Reuter',1 MONEY-SUPPLY}

Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd fromaround 370,000 in February after the emirate declared amid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, thesources added. Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaifand Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixedprices too high and cut liftings, the sources said. The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japaneseterm buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, theyadded. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of itMurban.

{0 'British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not theonly element standing in the way of full British membership ofthe European Monetary System (EMS). But he added that arguments against joining had weakened. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be thestrongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has madeclear she does not expect to consider joining until after thenext UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest. But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters afteran informal European Community finance ministers\' meeting herethat other factors apart from the upcoming election stood inthe way of full membership. In addition to the question of the exchange rates at whichBritain should enter the EMS\'s core exchange rate mechanism,there was also the impact of sterling membership on the systemto be considered, he said. British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar systembased on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterlingsystem, he noted. \"We have to make sure it would work.\" But Lawson added that some of the considerations that hadmade it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posedless of a problem. As an example he cited sterling\'s role as a petrocurrency,which he said was diminishing. \"That argument has clearlyweakened,\" he said.

{0 'European Community (EC)finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need forgreater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System(EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said. \"There was a general will to reinforce the European MonetarySystem, with all that implies,\" Belgian Finance Minister MarkEyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session ofinformal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since thesecond major realignment of EMS parities within nine months inJanuary. The system has come under severe strain as funds haveflowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMScurrency, the West German mark, sending it soaring againstweaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February\'s agreement between leadingwestern industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates ataround current levels was working and this would allow the ECto speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of theEMS. He told a news conference yesterday\'s meeting agreed on theneed for closer coordination among EMS member governments ofinterest rate policies and of interest rate differentialsbetween different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination ofexchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, bothwhen they reached their fixed EMS limits and within theiragreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range oftechnical problems and ministers would discuss these further inLuxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC\'sMonetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economicconvergence betwen Community countries and it was importantthat interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchangerates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds thepresidency of the community, made clear the meeting had notproduced any agreement to move radically forward in developingthe EMS towards the EC\'s long term goal of economic andmonetary integration. \"We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normalfunctioning of the system,\" Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMShas to be reinforced if the EC\'s plans to liberalise allmovements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to goahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told themeeting the authority would put forward proposals for a finalphase of capital market liberalisation in October that wouldinclude safeguard clauses for member countries for which themove would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers alsodiscussed the need to \"dedramatise\" realignments of EMS paritiesby letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out bytelephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However, West German sources said Bonn Finance MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson toldjournalists that one of the technical issues raised by greatercoordination of exchange market intervention was the questionof which currencies should be used to intervene and held incentral bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS wouldwork better if central banks held each other\'s currencies -- anissue of particular importance regarding West Germany since theBundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignmentsreflected a general feeling among participants that the way theJanuary reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France andWest Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains inthe system that forced the parity overhaul. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by aroundone pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said inits Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices arehigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may bebelow last year\'s 3.6 pct, it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product pricesstay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users canbe expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain someof the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and theremay be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fellby 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of theyear. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd buta decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reportedstocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments builtup strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in theperiod. The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, moreor less in line with consumption, after declining for fiveyears, the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mlnbpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports fromcentrally-planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the firstquarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpdof crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln averagefor the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was thelargest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEAsaid.

An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that theeconomy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies adeclining economy.

{0 'U.S. Bond trading is likely to remaincautious in the near term with a possible downward price biasas market participants focus on trends in the dollar, theeconomy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said. Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed willkeep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months. Until trends are clearer, \"the market can only attempt to toestablish and hold a new trading range at higher interestrates,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthysaid that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthyinvestment climate, the market will have no confidence in thisenvironment until there is illumination of and confidence inU.S. Dollar/trade policy. Salomon Brothers\' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged ifcurrency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseaseconomic growth is perceived as slowing sharply. \"The crucial question, however, is how soon either of thesedevelopments is likely to occur,\" Kaufman said. \"Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio managerconfidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a whilelonger,\" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at IrvingSecurities Corp. However, Braverman said that, \"from a longer termperspective, current (bond) prices provide a buyingopportunity.\" Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday onunexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasurybonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole andThursday\'s 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high. Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a longbond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday. The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in asimilar \"paroxysm of pessimism,\" the key bonds reached a similarclosing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring theyield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points. Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc saidthat many portfolio managers now believe yields could approachnine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely. Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts havespoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher andthey continue to believe that an upward bias is likely topersist over the next few months. Held said that in conversations with portfolio managerslast week there appeared to be increasing belief that the raterise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct bymidyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall. \"Yields could rise further over the next few months, but therise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we\'ve seensince the start of the year,\" Held said. Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term. \"The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,\" saideconomists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push upinterest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollarand head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harmthe fragile U.S. Economic expansion. The Lanston economists said, \"The Fed cannot ease its policystance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calmdomestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat ofcausing a further decline in the dollar.\" Minutes of February\'s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policyunchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policylater if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or creditmarkets warranted a policy shift. However, economists generally believe that continued fairlysluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.Banks resulting from their problem loans to developingcountries rule out any Fed policy firming. There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC atlast Tuesday\'s meeting also left Fed policy unchanged. This week\'s U.S. Economic data are expected to have littleimpact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due onWednesday, with March producer price data out Friday. There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economicindicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. AFriday rumor had put the number far higher. The index\'s firstquarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNPgrowth of about three pct if continued through 1987.

Commenting on the company\'s longer term earnings outlook,Gluck said \"we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrsin 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lowerinterest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debtincurred in connection with the recapitalization.\" He said the company does not usually release projections,but has done so now beause of the significance of therecapitalization. Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted forstockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June. The plan will require the approval of stockholders and thatof the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities. As part of the plan, the company will change its state ofincorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger ofCaesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will providefor, among other things, a \"fair price\" provision requiring thatcertain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders beapproved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding sharesheld by such interested stockholders. Caesars World said in a statement that \"the cashdistribution will result in a substantial deficit instockholders\' equity.\" It did not give an estimate of the sizeof this deficit.

{0 'Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency said. Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by aroundone pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,the IEA said in its latest monthly report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if averageconsumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth forthese fuels may be below last year\'s 3.6 pct. The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain narcurrent levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some ofthe market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said. IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECDarea at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. Thisis about the same as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986. The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with company stocks rising, more or less in linewith consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said. Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were putat 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January oneand equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, downfrom the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to94 days of consumption. The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that companystocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the firstquarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd inMarch. And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have alsobeen a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, theIEA said. World oil supply fell through the first quarter by abouttwo bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpdin January and to the seasonal drop in exports from CentrallyPlanned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the firstquarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three monthsof 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd asagainst 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largestfactor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month,mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and memberswould submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said. However, Opec\'s discipline in holding its price and outputtargets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said. Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend todemands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-liftingfrom Japanese buyers.

{0 'The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt thedowntrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buyingoperations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said. Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases couldreach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting pricessignificantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhangingthe market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as theICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 SpecialDrawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level. Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed lastmonth by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the bufferstock manager has completed preparations, traders said. Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay bufferstock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months usedto calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day averageabove the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level. The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average ofthe second, third and fourth positions on the London and NewYork futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR pertonne yesterday. Months used currently for the indicator are May, July andSeptember, but these are set to change to July, September andDecember on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spotmonth, traders noted. The introduction of December into the calculations may liftthe daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75stg above May on the London terminal market. But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for thehigher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, theindicator which governs his activities, traders said. \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at theimplications of delaying until forward prices lift theindicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" ananalyst from a leading cocoa trade house said. Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reachthis level within six months, buying is suspended pending anICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa marketwatchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recentforecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mlnto two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up tothree mln. A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, comparedwith a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of94,000 tonnes, traders said. In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need tobuy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the\"must buy\" level. But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may putconstraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stockmanager can remove cocoa from the market. The buffer stock system of price differentials setaccording to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases fromnon-members could limit the buffer stock\'s scope for action,dealers said. Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock isnearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin. But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa asMalaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoacan only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the bufferstock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material. Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-membercocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which arepressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said. Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa fromquality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impacton futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums forthis cocoa over futures. Ghana\'s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stgfrom 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of bufferstock buying, dealers said. \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but willprovide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said. Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the bufferstock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope topredict accurately what the result would be. Psychologicallybuffer stock buying should help prices, but since the bufferstock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from theprevious cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealersexpressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure. In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholdingscheme as an additional market support mechanism. REUTER',1 COCOA}

ForEast Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986. It said new plantings had slowed markedly in bothcountries, but the effects of this will not be felt until1988-90. Above normal yields during recent years resulted in treesreacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more maleinflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said. Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affectedthis year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This couldespecially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June,while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April andJuly/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.

Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this yearwere put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 inJanuary 1986, Oil World said. West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of EastMalaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.

The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smithat a special committee meeting into the future of GATT followsa series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts bythe 93-nation body to promote fair trade. Today\'s meeting was part of the Uruguay trade roundlaunched by ministers last September. The round, which covers13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods andservices will take four years to negotiate. Smith called for boosting GATT\'s links with financialinstitutions such as the International Monetary Fund and WorldBank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers toensure the success of the Uruguay Round. \"The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened toassure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of theworld trading system and the global economy,\" Smith said. \"Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.\" He also also urged that member states be accountable toeach other for their trade policies. Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with EuropeanCommunity (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted tostress GATT\'s importance and did not discuss specifics. \"We are interested in more periodic ministerialinvolvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,\" he said. GATT\'s ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord onsemiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT traderules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanesechips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT disputepanel be set up to review the agreement.

{0 'Bundesbank council member LotharMueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policyand that restraining money supply growth does not always meanpushing up interest rates. Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitungfinancial daily that a monetary policy which took into accountexchange rate expectations and capital flows could not beconfused with an exchange rate oriented policy. The article followed international press speculation thatthe Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favourof an exchange rate policy. Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his positionas president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria,noted that the Bundesbank\'s decision in January to cut leadinginterest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had ledsome people to think it was dropping monetary targetting. \"Simply to ignore the external economic context would berisky and dangerous for monetary policy,\" he explained. Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put anend to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could nowassume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currencyinflows slow down. Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short andlong term interest rate differentials, also encouragedinvestors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Muellersaid. The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetarygrowth back onto the desired path, he said. \"Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep thisquiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with thechanged economic situation of the last few months,\" he added. \"All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its moneysupply policy with the January discount rate cut, despitesuppositions to the contrary,\" Mueller said. \"Keeping money supply developments in check is not alwayssynonymous with raising interest rates, especially whenexcessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather thangrowth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetaryholdings of non-banks,\" Mueller said. Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficitsother concepts were needed for monetary policy. Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous formonetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate. In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said. But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end ofa strict stability policy because both interest rates andliquidity would be affected by required currency interventionand could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank. Even interest rates are not in the centre of theBundesbank\'s considerations, but reflect competition and othermarket conditions, Mueller said. A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence centralbank money stock, the Bundesbank\'s main money supply indicator. This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidityof industry and households which cannot be directly reachedwith the Bundesbank\'s instruments, Mueller said. The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, theharder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly beenthe case recently, because non-banks have received considerablesums from current account surpluses and capital imports. \"If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply risewith higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate ifcredit was growing excessively, it would not only have missedits target but probably even set off further inflows,\" he said. Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high. In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rateof seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter. The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three tosix pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stockgrowth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said. But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and thereshould be no change in priorities. \"Monetary policy must befirst and foremost stability policy and successful stabilitypolicy is money supply policy -- nothing else,\" he said.

{0 'State-owned engine maker <Rolls RoycePlc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow withmany analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it islikely to miss contracts to power the proposed <AirbusIndustrie> A340 aircraft. The company\'s so-called \"pathfinder prospectus\" gives all thedetails of its stock market flotation except for the price atwhich shares will be offered. Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rosein 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before. Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profitfor 1987. Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profitsand a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rollsoperated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings. Assuming the company was valued at around eight timesearnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of theaerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards. BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between1.5 billion and 1.7 billion. The price will be increased by it being likely to have muchof its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure thecompany\'s health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls wasrescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971. When the government announced the sale, it said it wouldinject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company. Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a creditrating to match those of its main competitors such as GeneralElectric Co <GE.N> and United Technologies Corp\'s <UTX.N> Prattand Whitney unit.
