{0 'U.S. economic data this week could bethe key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures breakout of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said. Although market expectations are for February U.S. retailsales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthygains, figures within or slightly below expectations would bepositive for the market, the analysts said. \"You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bondsright now,\" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst CraigSloane. Treasury bond futures came under pressure today whichtraders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and arise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interestto break below chart support in the June contract failed tomaterialize, participants who had sold bond futures earlyquickly covered short positions, they said. \"Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come inas expected it won\'t be that bad for the market,\" Sloane said. Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sectorof retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct. Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figurebelow market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, andshe put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up0.8 to 1.2 pct. Industrial production and the producer price index Fridayboth are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, sheadded. Retail sales \"will tell us whether or not we will be ableto fill the gap,\" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in Junebonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bondsclosed at 100-4/32 today. Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to thefederal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, saidCarroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer. \"A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded themarket from breaking out of the trading range the last time themarket approached the top of the range,\" Singer said. In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,which is just below 102 in the June contract, \"the crude oilrally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,\"Singer said. \"Fed funds are already easing back down toward thesix pct level.\" The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern toManufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rallymay be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.

{0 'House trade lawmakers took theirfirst votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws butheld over until tomorrow the most difficult votes oncontroversial plans to protect American industries. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means TradeSubcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issuesin the bill--whether they will force major foreign tradingpartners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the UnitedStates. The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version ofDemocratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to openforeign markets but which drops last year\'s effort to forcePresident Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs. Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said thelawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and willconsider a proposal to mandate retaliation without settingspecific trade penalties. The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways andMeans Committee next week before the full House votes on it. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seekinghis party\'s 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer anamendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses ofthose countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods. This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan toforce a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surpluswith the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, WestGermany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances. \"My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard forgetting the trade deficit down,\" he told reporters. The trade law changes are to become part of a majorcongressional and administration effort to turn around therecord U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year byopening up foreign markets and making U.S. products morecompetitive. House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said againtoday he expects the full House will approve the trade bill byMay and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill. \"I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and MeansCommittee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effectivebill,\" he told reporters. The comprehensive trade bill will include work by othercommittees to ease export controls on high technology, to aidU.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulateresearch and development, to remove foreign trade barriers andto improve education and worker training. The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competitionif they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to thecountry\'s economic development. They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether toretaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules andwhether an injured industry deserves import relief. They agreed to make it easier for a company to gettemporary relief from import competition but agreed theindustry should provide a plan to become competitive. The administration has not announced its support butYeutter said yesterday, \"I am cautiously optimistic,\" that theDemocratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill. Reuter',1 TRADE}

Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said hehad discussed plant protection and the processing of highlysulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology foragricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetablejuice processing with Imec.

Estimates at the time showed aFrench 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986. Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk withanybody with \"interesting\" proposals offering latest technologyand assuring \"a mutual advantage.\" He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it andwould deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting. He encouraged companies to take advantage of new lawsguaranteeing \"the interests of foreign partners\" in jointventures. But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under thenew joint venture laws. He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as aresult of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow lastmonth with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng. He said Doumeng\'s Interagra company was preparing proposalsfor further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last monthsaid the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth ofgoods.

If importpropensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk fromprotectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japanhas so massive a surplus,\" he said. \"They may well succeed in securing action by governmentswhich would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japanand the U.K.\" Channon said there had been substantial growth in thevolume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2billion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year. But he added: \"Regrettably too much of it was in onedirection, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling(5.8 billion dlrs) more than we sold them.\" Reuter',1 TRADE}

The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billioninflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account ofgovernment foreign currency borrowings, it said.

Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve tieswith institutional investors, suggesting representatives ofthose institutions be granted seats on the boards of directorsof companies they invest in. \"Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,for that is but a short step from saying that they should beprotected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,the proprietors of the company,\" Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role toplay in furthering economies of scale, integration and moreefficient market penetration. \"The degree of success or failure(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether ornot the takeover was contested,\" he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeoveractivity in the recent past. \"The aim is to pressurise acompany\'s management into action dedicated solely to afavourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partlyor even primarily at the expense of the future,\" he said. Such bids \"often depend for their success on creating ahighly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, toengage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that areimmensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,\" hesaid.

He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this mayhave affected the crop, though it remains to be seen howseriously. Indonesia\'s main crop is harvested next month.

Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to risemuch from last year\'s level of 320,000 tonnes. \"I expect exportswill be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,\"he said. Exports in 1985/86 were valued at 944 mln U.S. Dlrs,but the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of lowprices, he added. Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan targetof 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is tryingto boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds,better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.

{0 'Saudi Arabia\'s 11 commercial banks arereporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasingprovisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non-performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to buildreserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline alittle this year. But the kingdom\'s still sluggish economy and legal problemshampering traditional lending operations mean earnings willremain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said \"The work is largelydone in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions,but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.\" The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia\'s corporate sector in1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - hastaken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results nowappearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broaddecline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom\'s banks hadsunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before worldoil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom\'s nine joint-venture banks which operate onthe Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported andrevealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 atthe expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, <United SaudiCommercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mlnriyals, marginally less than 1985\'s shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in partreflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearlytrebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show <Saudi American Bank>(SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7mln riyals, while <Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as SaudiFrench, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp\'s <CCI.N>Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,increased provisions sharply. <Arab National Bank>\'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mlnriyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in theSaudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economicactivity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banksare now at or close to international levels on provisions.\" From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom\'s largest bank <NationalCommercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals inprovisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to theprivate sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, <Riyad Bank>, NCB\'s rival as thesecond biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, hadcovered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operateon an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has beentightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule fordeclaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figuresdifficult because some banks still book non-accruing interestas revenue while others follow more conservative practices inforce in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and thejoint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rankas the strongest earners. Other banks such as <Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned bythe <British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by arelatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mlnriyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show anotherlow figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the mostconservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see aSaudi bank go under and not only supported <Saudi Cairo Bank>after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also madeavailable cheap deposits to <Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, butgenerally banks are awash with liquidity since they areunwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets canattempt to diversify away from traditional lending,conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generatefee income from new investment banking products. One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are notgood.\" Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount ofadvances is showing a declining trend, while the days whenbanks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts toinvest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better returnon their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to currentaccounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customerfunds are held on current account. REUTER',1 EARN}

{0 'Indonesian coffee exporters arepreparing for a period of depressed prices while urging theirgovernment to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue ofexport quotas, the chairman of the Association of IndonesianCoffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters. Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia,the world\'s third largest producer, is trimming costs andimproving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas. \"But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, wecan never bridge the gap,\" Dharyono said. Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries,along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed anew quota system at last month\'s failed International CoffeeOrganistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under theGroup of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contactswith Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICOnegotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eightwere in contact with Colombia, the world\'s second largestproducer, but gave no details. \"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from acompromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present marketstays like it is,\" Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as theU.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead ofan ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S.And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and pressthem to present Indonesia\'s case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help thecountry\'s coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground withthe big consumers because they agreed on the need for basingquotas on what he termed \"realistic criteria.\" The breakaway group believes the old quota system, whichgives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does notreflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the oldsystem be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when marketprices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point whereexport controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumersat the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on newguidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are bothrefusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believedIndonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and theAICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said. Indonesia\'s coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30,is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year\'s levelof 360,000 tonnes, he said. He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average forthe time of year. REUTER',1 COFFEE}

He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate andless competition from the European Community should lead in theGulf area to higher beef sales, which dropped from 33,000tonnes in 1980 to just 2,300 tonnes last year. \"In the last three to four months there has been aresurgence of inquiries,\" he said. Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to SaudiArabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess marketpotential. On beef exports, he said a 50 pct drop in EuropeanCommunity intervention stock in the past 12 months would helpAustralian sales. The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in thesemarkets, where the Australian trade was the natural source ofsupply, and Australia was \"now back in,\" Frawley said. He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether theMiddle East market for livestock, which accounts for two-thirdsof meat export value to the area, would be maintained. He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demandfor fresh meat. The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia,the biggest single market, was 3,214,159 compared with2,939,226 in 1985. The numbers shipped to the United ArabEmirates and Bahrain fell, however. Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had beenoffset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean. Other than livestock, Australia\'s overall meat sales to theMiddle East rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnesthe previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes ofmutton and lamb to Iran.

Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve tieswith institutional investors, suggesting representatives ofthose institutions be granted seats on the boards of directorsof companies they invest in. \"Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,for that is but a short step from saying that they should beprotected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,the proprietors of the company,\" Leigh-Pemberton said.

Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded thecompany\'s target of five pct real annual growth, had been madepossible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year. Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economicaffairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24billion francs was due to currency factors. A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offsetby growth in operations and by structural changes within thegroup. Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francsfrom 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolatesector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. Thetonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices andlower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.

Theloan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or otherlitigation connected with the specific properties involved andcould involve the suspension of interest and principal paymentsto some of the lenders. Southwest said if the attempts torestructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more ofthe properties.

A private placement recently brought the number ofoutstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July31, 1986, the fiscal yearend. \"The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,\"Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to applyfor listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange.

Results for the thirdquarter should be about the same as the second, he added. Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195dlrs in the second quarter. After \"a disastrous first quarter,\" Sand hopes to break evenin the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company hasscaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the33.5 mln dlrs projected in December. The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. andCanadian dollars last year led to Sand\'s loss of 2.1 mln dlrs,or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs. In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585dlrs. Shattner believes the company will post better results thisyear due to several factors. \"Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buyingproducts in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachiin U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in thesecond quarter,\" he said.

{0 'The worst may be just about over forJapan\'s battered economy but economists said they do not expecta vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economistspolled by Reuters said the economy\'s 18 month-old slowdown islikely to end in the first half of this year, helped by risingexports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. \"Theeconomy will bottom out in the middle of the year,\" saidSumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist SusumuTaketomi agreed. \"It (the bottom) is in the offing,\" he said. But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in thefiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct,from two pct in the current year, he said. Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worstare increasing. The volume of exports in the first two months of the yearrose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining towardthe end of last year. Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as asharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks,several economists said it could mark the beginning of arecovery. Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smallerthan expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan surveyreleased last week showed that the decline in Japanesecorporate earnings may be nearing its end. And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopesthe rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said. Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. AndWest Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilisecurrencies around current levels. The yen\'s 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last twoyears has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing itscompanies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market. \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said. If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raiseinvestment in plant and equipment, although there are no signsof that yet, economists said. A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of theircompetitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting torecover, economists said. Domestically, the economy may get a boost from someloosening of the government\'s tight fiscal policy said HaruoMuto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. The next reading of the economy\'s health should come earlynext week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,1986. Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct fromthe previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct. But a senior government official said the fourth quarterfigures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one pointquarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statisticalaberration and not a significant shift in economic activity. To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, theeconomy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourthquarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong. The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably astatistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of1986, the official said. Economists said the fourth quarter figures were alsodistorted by the government\'s sale of gold coins in the secondhalf of 1986. Because the coins were classified as legal tender, theirpurchase did not show up in the statistics on consumerexpenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in Decemberbecause of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-yearbonuses, they said. As the government had to buy back some of the coins fromretailers because they were unsold, the government\'scontribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have beenboosted, economists said. Taketomi said it may have received a further boost fromgovernment buying of farm products as the domestic crop lastyear was good. The senior government official said the fourth quarterperformance of the domestic sector was probably worse thangenerally expected, while that of the external sector wasbetter. REUTER',1 GNP}

{0 'Most Japanese companies have decided notto renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spotprices remain considerably lower than OPEC\'s official levels,industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubaitraded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to itsofficial price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract forIranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting atotal of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crudeunder term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift inthe second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discountson cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discountsdepended largely on the levels of spot prices. \"If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we wouldprobably buy Iranian crude at the official price,\" one Japaneserefiner said. \"We don\'t intend to put pressure on them,\" he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oilat official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades areconsiderably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be noproblem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil afterfinding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem islikely to recur in April, adding to that country\'s surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself fromOPEC\'s December production agreement, while agreeing to thefixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close toits first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demandwould be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structurebased on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuationsshould be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai anda 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea\'s Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said, \"At the moment there\'s a lot ofpressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold outthere will be no problem, and I\'m beginning to trust theirability.\" Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukmantold a news conference in Lagos yesterday, \"Nigeria and allmember countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold theDecember agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotasand official selling prices.\" He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocksof both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levelswell below this time last year.

{0 'Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasizeimproving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt,C.J. \"Pete\" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview. \"Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assetsalready installed,\" he said, but he declined to estimate annualcash flow for 1987. Analysts estimate Phillips\" cash flow at over one billiondlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted fromrestructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hoversabout 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986. Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raisingthe capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gasproperties. \"We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cashflow prospects,\" he said. He projected a capital expenditurebudget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mlndlrs. Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration andproduction, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silassaid. \"Phillips\' top priority in 1987 will be to get thewaterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields toimprove our ability to extract oil and increase earnings,\" Silassaid. Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected tocost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln grossbarrels of oil over a period of 24 years. Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silassaid he was seeking \"a modification of terms with the Chinesegovernment to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijangfields) commercially viable.\" In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the PointArguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. \"Weexpect to start up the first platform then,\" Silas said. But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced thecompany to part with several oil and gas assets. Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K.North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that isnow completed, Silas said. \"We sold high cost producing assets. They were not goodvalue for us but possibly so for someone else,\" Silas said.

{0 'Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen toits lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence ofthe kingdom\'s determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs abarrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sourcessaid. They said Saudi output in the first eight days of Marchaveraged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from theneutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February averageof 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crudeoil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must becounted towards a member\'s production quota. Saudi Arabia\'squota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, theworld\"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opecofficial prices, even at the cost of lower production, thesources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview withReuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudicommitment to OPEC\'s December pact to boost oil prices to anaverage 18 dlrs. \"Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,\" hesaid. The sources said the kingdom\'s exports from Gulf portsaveraged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuatewith lifting nominations and was not trying to maintainartificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom\'s main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms withpast stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon,Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in thetiming and volume of their liftings but are bound to payofficial prices, the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks butstill remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayedliftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.

{0 'British Telecommunications Plc\'s <BTY.L>profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced byincreasing competition and continued costs for replacing oldtelephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said. Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter resultswhich were released earlier today, Odgers said the companyfaced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systemsin Britain for three to five years. He said <Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and WirelessPlc <CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor. Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into someof British Telecom\'s most profitable areas. One company official privately estimated that BritishTelecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunicationsmarket but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct. The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, whichlead to some disruption in service, could well have encouragedclients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said. However, he forecast that the last quarter\'s resultsoverall should not be adversely affected by the walkout. He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls shouldbe limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities. But on balance Odgers said that group\'s financial strength,economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growthindustry will help produce annual profit increases for theforseeable future. British Telecom will also seek to expand intomanufacturing, he said, adding that research and developmentexpenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared withthe current proportion of two pct of overall turnover. Analysts said the company\'s downbeat forecasts helpedshares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday\'sclose and off an early high of 248p. Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd saidthe market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a sevento eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profitover the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-taxprofit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion. Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linkingcharges to inflation meant that the company\'s scope for raisingprices was limited as long as inflation remains low. Reuter',1 EARN}
{0 'The Brazilian Coffee Institute,IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until theend of next week at the earliest, trade sources said. IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting governmentministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assessBrazil\'s position in the light of the failure of talks inLondon earlier this month to set new International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, export quotas. \"The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethinkits position completely,\" one Santos exporter said. A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set forThursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explainhis plan to members then before announcing any new measures. Dauster told reporters on his return from London last weekthat no decisions would be made on exports before he had heldtalks with all sectors of the industry. Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure tostart marketing coffee immediately. World prices have beenrecovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICOtalks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilosfor export in the first four months of this year. The exporters said the key factor in the eventual openingof May and June export registrations will be the amount atwhich the contribution quota is set. With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanismssuch as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees beingintroduced, the level of the quota will be decisive indetermining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on worldmarkets, they said. They noted that on February 16, the eve of a plannedincrease in the quota, April registrations were opened andclosed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a recordamount for a single day. If May/June registrations are opened under similarconditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty inselling at least 2.0 mln bags per month. \"The problem would be how to limit sales,\" one exporter said. Brazil\'s present foreign trade and payments problems meanthere are pressures from the government to boost exports tomaximise foreign exchange earnings. However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt amarketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil\'s dominantposition as an exporter, but without causing a price war. General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would planto export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO. The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be aroundthe figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas werereintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired withthe breakdown of talks. With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags thisyear, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags aftermeeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added. However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even toconsider exporting such quantities, as this would almostinevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried toencroach on other producers\' markets. Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderlymarketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil\'smarket share after last year\'s unusually low exports of 9.9 mlnbags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordialrelations with the producer group which backed Brazil\'s stanceat the ICO talks, they added.

{0 'U.S. retail sales rose sharply inFebruary but many economists said the underlying consumerspending trend remains weak. February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January\'ssales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previouslyreported 5.8 pct decline. \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at amuch more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland MontaguCapital Markets Inc. Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales dataover past four months to show that the pace of consumerspending is slowing. Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in Novemberand a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gainover the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4pct rise for year-over-year sales through February. \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn\'tbe surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since salesprobably won\'t be boosted by auto sales as they were inFebruary.\" Despite the weak underlying trend, economists wereimpressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excludingautos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct declinein January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline. \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gainsin durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthyof Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthyreport.\" He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in Februaryafter falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise storesales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January. \"There are signs of life in the economy,\" McCarthy said.\"But it\'s jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this reportinto the future.\" A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in Januarywhich may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boostspending in February, he said. \"A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholdingtaxes from their paychecks,\" he said. \"When people in thiscountry get an increase in disposable income, the inclinationis to go out and spend it,\" he said. Economists said tomorrow\'s release of U.S. auto sales forthe first 10 days of March will be an important indicator ofhow much this sector will add to first quarter spending. Auto sales accounted for the lion\'s share of totalFebruary sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct dropin January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largelyto the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax lawsJanuary 1, the Commerce Department noted. Some economists argued that the because the gain in totalsales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, thestrength in the February report is less than impressive. \"There is strength in the February data, but that\'s becausethey were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said saidBeth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don\'t see it as aprecursor of continued strength.\" Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higheroil prices rather than an increased volume of gas salesprobably accounted for these gains. Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spendingis weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billiondlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, theyfell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and inFebruary rose to 122.29 billion dlrs. \"On average, it looks like they\'ll total 120 to 121 mlndlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don\'t look at thisas indication that the economy is barrelling along.\" \"The number is not really that problematic for those of uswho are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Plattof Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetarypolicy on the basis of the latest retail sales report. \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been soconfusing,\" he said. \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payrollemployment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut inMarch,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait forthe first quarter real U.S. gross national product data inApril to sort things out.\" Reuter',1 RETAIL}

It said a preliminary survey showed the region could holdbillions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential asan energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gasexploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain awildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior\'s report failed to stress theprobability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior\'s study also failed to weigh oil, gas,fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gatherednor had the department consulted the Environmental ProtectionAgency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that anine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of theissue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possibleexploration of oil, only that Interior\'s study was inadquate tomake a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there waslittle sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area forcommercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that theUnited States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil. reuter',1 CRUDE}

The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the lasteffort to adopt an accord to replace the current one whichexpires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countriesare taking part in the two-week meeting. Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved bytomorrow he would hold weekend meetings. At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meetingin nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settlethose issues this week so that technical drafting work can bedone next week. Conference sources said it is highly unlikely thatproducers will accept a pact that will provide for any possibledownward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed byconsumers under certain circumstances. The sources said this means that any possible adjustmentwould centre on the reference price, and the \"may buy\" (or \"maysell\") and \"must buy\" (or \"must sell\") levels without changing the\"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact. The present five-day average of the indicator price isaround 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents. Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price,set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents akilo, and of the \"lower indicative price\" if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals insteadof the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism torespond automatically to market trends. At present, if the market price has been above or below thereference price for six months, the reference price is revisedby five pct or by an amount decided by the InternationalNatural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustmentbe automatic at five pct or more. Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council inthe price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern thatchanges proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact. Reuter',1 RUBBER}

{0 'Pessimism over the effects of aprolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop isrising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mlnbag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital ofSalvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, whichbroke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up ashoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in thefirst three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might onlyreach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as podsfrom current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noteda late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, whichflourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is morelikely from late July on. This year\'s crop is doubly susceptible because poor pricesmean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers andinsecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremelyvulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of therains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly becausethe drought had caused a drop in the insect population whichpollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels arenow generally back to near normal levels and that currentflowering and pod setting is good, which should result inmature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting ofbeans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of themain crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things gowell from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a breakfrom August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao proveaccurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for thepast 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 whenprolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mlnbags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced atemporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bagrecord, while last year\'s output, which also suffered somedrought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwardsby the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed tohave been undeclared from this year\'s record total harvest andthey were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by theend of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by theinclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to portwarehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year,significant amounts have deteriorated because they were storedtoo long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expectedto be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao andmain crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeksstill to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should beat least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last yearof 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current cropbeans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporaoand thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never beofficially registered.

{0 'Purolator Courier corp\'s stock rose onspecualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director wouldfind a new suitor for the company, traders said. Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members ofits Purolator courier division\'s management. The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one. Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resignedfrom its board of directors in a letter dated March 10. The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board becausethe merger agreement with Hutton barred directors fromsoliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get abetter deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might befound if the company would agree to be sold to some otherentity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courierdivision. \"Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has450 mln dlrs in revenues. It\'s a very large company and it\'sbeing sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,\" said Gardner in a telephoneinterview with Reuters. Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firmassociated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelitycompanies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said hepersonally owns 20,000 shares. A Purolator official said the company has no comment on theletter from Gardner. Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger servicemay emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before thetransaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had alsospeculated another courier company would be the most likelysuitor. While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be nonew bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushedthe stock into play again. \"There\'s no shortage of possibilities. It\'s just a questionof management\'s willingness to let the process continue,\" saidone arbitrager. Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because theybelieve Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrscash per share. The balance of Purolator\'s stock will be boughtfor securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.courier operations. The arbitragers said tender offer documents show thatHutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction andwill emerge with a giant, majority equity interest inPurolator. \"As far as I can tell from the public documents from thedeal that\'s on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.One always likes a situation like that. You always like tothink if they can do this deal at no risk, there should besomeone else in the world that could do it higher,\" said onearbitrager. The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, andsources close to the transaction disputed the claim that thefirm will not end up paying for its equity position. While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer documentdid note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have tokeep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is somerisk to the firm. \"There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,and all sorts of things that make it very speculative,\" saidone of the sources, adding there are also severance payments toemployees. The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrsin so-called \"bridge\" financing for the transaction. The bridgefinancing is a temporary loan from Hutton. The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time toreplace the financing, the source said, resulting in what couldbe a substantial expense to the firm. Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mlndlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transactionsaid fees are at the low end of the scale. \"It\'s a very complex transaction, but basically whathappens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recaptureany investment they might have once the merger takes place,\"Gardner said.

A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply adifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.

An aide to Glickmansaid that it will probably be introduced next week. Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer toforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiencypayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided underthe current bill.

A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply adifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.

Period. Unequivocal,\" Glickman saidat the hearing. Sen.

Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. Hisplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment toparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put toconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extraidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acresin a county and provide tenant protection provisions. \"I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, butwe can at least move in that direction,\" Boschwitz said.

{0 'Bolivia is to make a formal offer duringthe next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt fromcommercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bankpresident Jier Nogales said. Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steeringcommittee of Bolivia\'s creditor banks had agreed to considerthe offer at a meeting in New York last month. He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivianpaper on the international secondary debt market, where it nowtrades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value. Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy backits commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid thediscounted rate in full. Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to30 years at interest rates below those fixed in theinternational markets, he added. Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loansto commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said therewould be no money available to restart traditional debtservicing to them for some time. Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes tocancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs,but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make aformal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt atdiscounted rates. Nogales said practical and strategic considerations woulddetermine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made inthe next few months. He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks overthe price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would makea single non-negotiable offer. He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendlycreditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The onlytraditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which wouldmean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater lossprovisions, he added. \"We are confident that the banks are going to bereasonable,\" Nogales said. \"Now they can resolve their problemsfor once and for all.\" \"The most conservative ones who want a little more willwait a year, but I don\'t know if the window of opportunity willbe open all the time,\" he added. Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia\'s fourbillion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed togovernments and the rest to international agencies, Nogalessaid negotiators had achieved considerable success in recentdiscussions with the Paris Club. He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to rescheduleBolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, whileaccepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interestrates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under ParisClub rules, he added. He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregardpenalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing withArgentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt. He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans frominternational agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400mln dlrs in disbursements this year. The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changedfrom a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflowof 130 mln dlrs last year, he added. Nogales said that Bolivia\'s net international reserves nowstood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs indisposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssorotook office in August, 1985. Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct ayear in the government\'s first month in office, was now down to10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and theplan was that it should continue at this level.

{0 'Bolivia is to make a formal offer duringthe next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt fromcommercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bankpresident Jier Nogales said. Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steeringcommittee of Bolivia\'s creditor banks had agreed to considerthe offer at a meeting in New York last month. He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivianpaper on the international secondary debt market, where it nowtrades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value. Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy backits commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid thediscounted rate in full. Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to30 years at interest rates below those fixed in theinternational markets, he added. Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loansto commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said therewould be no money available to restart traditional debtservicing to them for some time. Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes tocancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs,but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make aformal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt atdiscounted rates. Nogales said practical and strategic considerations woulddetermine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made inthe next few months. He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks overthe price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would makea single non-negotiable offer. He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendlycreditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The onlytraditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which wouldmean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater lossprovisions, he added. \"We are confident that the banks are going to bereasonable,\" Nogales said. \"Now they can resolve their problemsfor once and for all.\" \"The most conservative ones who want a little more willwait a year, but I don\'t know if the window of opportunity willbe open all the time,\" he added. Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia\'s fourbillion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed togovernments and the rest to international agencies, Nogalessaid negotiators had achieved considerable success in recentdiscussions with the Paris Club. He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to rescheduleBolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, whileaccepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interestrates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under ParisClub rules, he added. He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregardpenalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing withArgentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt. He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans frominternational agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400mln dlrs in disbursements this year. The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changedfrom a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflowof 130 mln dlrs last year, he added. Nogales said that Bolivia\'s net international reserves nowstood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs indisposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssorotook office in August, 1985. Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct ayear in the government\'s first month in office, was now down to10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and theplan was that it should continue at this level. He said the government was also expecting at least threepct growth in gdp this year after several years of negativerates. Reuter',1 RESERVES}

Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exactform of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the Houseapproved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cutby those countries. The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation fromother committees dealing with relaxation of export controls,incentives for research, expanded worker training and educationand other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness. The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by thefull House in late April and then will be considered by Senatecommittees. It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreignunfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs andallow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed byU.S. actions against other countries. The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to winrelief from surges of imports of competitive products. It extends until January 1993, the administration\'sauthority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the newround of multilateral talks under the General Agreements onTariffs and Trade.

Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference theSaudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose suchconditions after Brazil\'s decision to halt interest payment ofits commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oilconsumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds anddecide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobraswill lift the order to cancel the shipment.

If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be muchbetter for us, because with the market prices more or less thesame, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,\" he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importingBrazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothingfrom Brazil, he said.

But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committeedebate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt tomandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. bycountries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exactform of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the Houseapproved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cutby those countries.

Fed data released today were all in line with economists\'expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks. The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the twoweeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mlndlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changedfrom 160 mln dlrs in the period before that. It said that banks\' net free reserves in the latest twoweeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously. Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs. Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actualpositive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3. February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limitsset by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target. \"In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for theFed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in moneygrowth,\" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman GovernmentSecurities Inc. Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetarygrowth in March after February\'s anemic growth rates. However,they stress that money growth will not be strong enough toprevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if theeconomy shows evidence of weakness. Commenting on February\'s decline in the key M-2 aggregate,Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in moneymarket deposits at banks. This number has risen three to fourbillion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February\'sweakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March. Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should returnto the five to seven pct annualized growth region and socontinue to present no problem for the Fed. Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable withits current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhapsseveral more months of economic data before deciding whether ornot to ease its grip on reserves.

{0 'Colombia intends to improve themarketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility onsetting export registration prices, finance minister CesarGaviria said. Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower exportregistration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dockNew York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile. \"In the first stage, we decided not only to lower thereintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro thatwill allow private exporters to participate more actively inColombia\'s coffee export policy,\" he said. Traders said this means the export registration price willchange more often in a truer reflection of market trends. Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new marketfactors since a return to a system of International CoffeeOrganisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the shortterm. ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlockover re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February1986. Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily sufferfrom depressed prices because it can compensate lower priceswith increased volume. \"Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount ofcoffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will doso without an agreement among producers,\" he said. He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5mln bags as mentioned in market circles, \"because the idea isprecisely not to disrupt the market.\" Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86coffee year which ended last September 30. Echoing Gaviria\'s words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of thenational coffee growers\' federation, said Colombia sought toadapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances. \"There is great expectation in the world for the policiesthat Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning toemerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in theimmediate future,\" he told journalists. Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil\'s future exportpolicy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week. Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place whenproblems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talkshave been resolved. Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta sayingIndonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil tosuggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said theBrazilian stand was quite clear. He said Brazil\'s current quota \"reflects the reality of themarket, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,\" butadded more clarity was needed to assess the criteria thatdetermined it. Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failureof the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear amongdealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producerswould go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,which did not happen.

{0 'Senior U.S. Economic officialsdisagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budgetdeficit reduction targets. Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of EconomicAdvisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration\'s opposition toa tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cuttingspending and fostering economic growth. By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the CongressionalBudget Office, said the budget process has broken down and thedeficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York Universitythat spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on thedesire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibilityfor local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows thePresident to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, tolimit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions shouldbe linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pctgrowth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate ofeconomic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks prettygood to me. We\'ve had two very strong employment reports.\" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,\"It looks like they\'re on track.\" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the taxreform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and willgreatly increase private production incentives, he said. \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggestnational net output of goods and services will permanentlyincrease by approximately two pct because of the long-runconsequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this wouldhave amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in theincome of the average American family.\" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsiblefor the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amountedto 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct ofGNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage pointshigher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budgetdeficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said. \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced taxincreases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office\'s Rudolph Pennerargued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxesenormously without any plan to decrease spending by theAdministration or Congress, indeed with increases in defencespending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)are unpleasant,\" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideologicalturmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflationin our nation\'s history,\" which helped foster widespreaddistrust of government. \"The American people turned on the government with taxrevolt at the state level and new demands on the government atthe national level,\" Penner said. \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislikeof spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistakedemands that the system change a lot.\" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budgetdeficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit willremain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily isnot likely to succeed. \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries todictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simplybecause there\'s no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budgetdeficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminatedby one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxesrelated to tax reform and sales of government assets. \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creativetiming changes, like moving the military payday from the lastday of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That savedmore than two billion dlrs,\" Penner said. REUTER',1 GNP}

{0 'China has to decide if it will increasesugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output andrising demand, in view of market predictions that internationalsugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and theofficial press said. He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry andFisheries, said this week that China has adjusted thepurchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop inproduction last year but he gave no price details. One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidlybecause of improving living standards and rising demand forsweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods. \"It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in astate-controlled economy. China may have to import,\" he said. Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes inJanuary 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986. The official Economic Information newspaper last month saidproduction in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April)will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand. The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes. \"In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beethas fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has droppedand cannot meet demand that is rising every day,\" it said. \"The country will have to continue imports of sugar and drawdown stocks to meet market demand,\" it added. It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming thedrop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for caneand beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmersrefusing to grow them. The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to threetimes more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up toseven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He couldsell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane. Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices havenot changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said. In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuanin 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills\' profit to 117yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added. The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losingmoney. China has 521 sugar mills.

He said both provinces are more developed than othersugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities. But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,because cane-growing is more economic there, he said. He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986. A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mlnat end-January. \"Now they are falling but (they) have notreached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,\"he said. \"China has options not easily available in westerncountries. It controls stocks strictly and can release lessinto the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,\" he said. The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will beslightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world pricesand serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, arelikely to continue until at least end-1988. He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-ownedmills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers. \"Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many ofthem using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,\" he said.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked theWhite House to consider blocking the sale of <FairchildSemiconductor Corp> to Japan\'s Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T>, U.S.Officials said yesterday. Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave theU.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital hightechnology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence SecretaryCaspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale. U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu apowerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers whileJapan\'s supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales. Takemoto said national security should not be an issuesince the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner,Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>, does not include Fairchild\'s maindefence-related division. In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputertrade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not makesupercomputers. Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticatedmicrochips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chipsand supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said. Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposedtakeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying \"the purchasewould not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductormarket.\" Two separate issues appear to have come together to boostpressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said. The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open itsdomestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said. U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanesepublic sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despiteU.S. Firms\' technological lead in the field. \"The United States believes Japan will only react whenbullied, and this is a bullying ploy,\" Salomon Brothers Asiaanalyst Carole Ryavec said. However, the analysts said more is at stake thansupercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vitalsemiconductor industry to Japanese competitors. \"The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,\"said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co. U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade hasfailed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan\'s Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firmsto abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricingand opening Japan\'s market.

{0 'Sandoz AG <SANZ.Z> wouldhave reported a percentage rise in net profits \"close to doublefigures\" rather than the actual two pct had it not been forNovember\'s warehouse fire, a senior company official said. The official, who declined to be identified, told ReutersSandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope withthe consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, whichcaused severe pollution of the Rhine. Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profitsto 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pctincrease in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share. This year began well, with the performance in January andFebruary at least equal to the same period last year, theofficial said. The company is expected to give fuller details of itsresults at a news conference on April 22. Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to coverany liability arising from the accident. The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the\"one pct\" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntarygestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollutionfrom the fire. Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have beenflowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering theRhine since the accident. However, the official said the final figure would be \"muchless than that cited in earlier comments.\" He gave no furtherdetails. In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy <CIGZ.Z>,which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were alsohit by the falling dollar, the official said. Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, withmarket share increases in the United States and Japan. But thiswas more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchangeeffect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said. Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billionfrancs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs. The third major Swiss chemical company, F.

{0 'Schweizerische Aluminimum AG <ALUZ.Z>(Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansingits balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said. \"The threshold of profitability has returned to theforeseeable future,\" he said. \"We expect already in 1987approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, thatour industrial environment does not worsen.\" He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of pastlosses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion andnet turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a newsconference the new management installed a year ago had decidedto restate the previous five years\' accounts to eliminaterights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as anasset. Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took angross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiaryin the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in1985. Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from1985, had wiped out the company\'s remaining reserves andexceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this \"radicalelimination of the mortgages of the past\" painful, but said thefoundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses, the company\'s liquidity wasstrong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pctin 1985. In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse hadarranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank ofSwitzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and CreditSuisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into asubordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and notcash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used onlyto a small extent, and the parent company had been granted anew credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swissbanks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintainingbauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc lossinstead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders\' equity of1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similaralternations were made for previous years. After 1986 losses, shareholder\'s equity stood at only 895mln francs. REUTER',1 EARN}

{0 'The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world moneymarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stabilityin Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,which holds eight European Community currencies within narrowfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), hasbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alikeseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu asEurope\'s common currency took a step nearer to becoming realitywhen Belgium minted the world\'s first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so farblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system\'sfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt andformer French President Valery Giscard d\'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two yearsafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have beentransferred from national governments and central banks to anautonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty ineconomic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS isthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to asituation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said oneeconomist who has closely watched the system\'s development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy onthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is thesystem\'s greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged andinvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharprise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose againstEMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And asWest Germany last year refused to give in pressure from severalEC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slowthe mark\'s rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to easefinancial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revaluedby three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pctagainst other currencies in the system -- the French franc,Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain\'s failure to lend theEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major worldcurrency, outside the system. No change in the British government\'s attitude is expectedbefore the country\'s next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system\'s last realignment, the 11th since itwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC\'shighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of CentralBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministershold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involvemore than tinkering with technical details. They are scepticalabout the chances for any fundamental change. \"Technical measures won\'t be enough to protect the EMSagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that wemust take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leode Corel of Kredietbank\'s economic research department. Economists say the system\'s fortunes now will dependlargely on the success of an agreement last month among majorindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollarresumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, theypredict. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'Negotiations on a new InternationalNatural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching themake-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear tobe in the balance, delegates said. Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRArenegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a smallgroup of producers and consumers to try to resolve majoroutstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto saidthose issues should be settled by the end of the first week toallow time to draft an agreement during the second week. The talks are due to last until March 20. Xuto said, \"There is nothing concrete yet, but theatmosphere is good.\" The discussions are expected to continuelate into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekendmeetings. Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree towhich price adjustments should be automatic. At present, if the market price has been above or below thereference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kiloin the current agreement) for six months, the reference priceis revised by five pct or by an amount decided by theInternational Natural Rubber Organisation council. Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, theadjustment be automatic at five pct or more. Producers want the council to have the last word and haveresisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure. Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settlinganother issue -- that of the floor price. It now appears that consumers may consider dropping theirinsistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, calledthe \"lower indicative price,\" under certain circumstances. This means that any possible compromise would centre on thereference price, and the \"may buy\" (or \"may sell\") and \"must buy\" or\"must sell\" levels, without changing the \"lower indicative price\"-- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the currentpact. Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility onthe floor price question, producers may consider agreeing toanother consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.

{0 'The Soviet Union has been a heavybuyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a reportfrom the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade. Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have alreadybeen committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of thissold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Associationreported to the U.S. official. In a report dated March 10, the official said that about800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balanceof 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June. An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped fromJuly-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslavcorn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said. Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslavcorn exports are due to the increased use of river barges forexporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said. Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averagedaround 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlierestimates of 150,000, the official said. The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslavcorn sales during this marketing year, he said. Reuter',1 GRAIN}

{0 'The U.S. Has dropped its insistence thatthe floor price in a new International Natural RubberAgreement, INRA, be revised downward under certaincircumstances, conference sources said. The surprise conciliatory move by the U.S. Meets one of theproducers\' main concerns -- that the floor price, or \"lowerindicative price,\" remain unchanged, they said. It is not clear, however, whether all consuming countrieswill follow suit, as a number of them, in particular Britain,West Germany and Belgium, appeared to have strong reservations,the sources added. The group of consumers has been seeking an adjustment ofthe \"lower indicative price\" (set at 150 Malaysian/Singaporecents a kilo in the present pact) if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes. The sources said the question of to what extent priceadjustments should be automatic remains a problem.

Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said thata possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in boththe financial markets and the Federal Reserve. \"The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectationstoday,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International. While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easiermonetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise thiscould necessitate a weaker dollar. \"The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,\" hesaid. \"We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete withforeign producers.\" Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pctin February\'s PPI. With many electronic goods producedoverseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raisingprices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said. If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminishoverseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which mightnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices. By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting toa large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real valueof the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987. Slifer said import prices may rise further asmanufacturers\' contracts put in place before the dollar droppedto current levels expire, and new contracts are made thatreflect a weaker dollar. David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that importedmanufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in thesecond half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.industrial output. \"It\'s the other side of the lower dollar,\" Wyss said.\"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitiveand they are increasing output.\" Wyss said that the latest data point to an averageindustrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.\"It\'s an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector isbeginning to revive.\" But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. Hesaid much of the strength came from factors that do not pointto a sustained rise in industrial output. Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farmequipment industries helped account for a one pct rise inFebruary business equipment production. Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energywas produced, not that manufacturing activity gained. Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted forhalf of the industrial production gain as production of autoassemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5million units. \"In the first quarter, it looks like automakers areproducing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling atroughly a seven mln unit rate,\" Roach said. \"The disparitybetween output and sales is showing up in inventories.\" Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. businessinventories as a sign that production may be outstrippingdemand in the first quarter of 1987.

{0 'Brazil\'s labour troubles eased alittle today as the authorities announced they were withdrawingtroops from the country\'s main oil installations occupied threedays ago. The troops went in at the request of the state-oil companyPetrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oilindustry employees. Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested thewithdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries wascalm, it said, and the employees had indicated theirwillingness to negotiate a pay deal. A national seamen\'s strike, however, continued and marinesremained in the country\'s main ports. The marines weredespatched to the ports after the seamen\'s strike, now twoweeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday. A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio deJaneiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports. Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transportof chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with theirseamen who have secured a 120 pct increase. Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as asign that the national strike could soon come to an end. Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and unionleaders said the vast majority of Brazil\'s 40,000 seamen werestill on strike. The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appearedtoday to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that thecompany would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio deJaneiro next Wednesday. Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator. Besides industrial troubles, there has also beenconsiderable unrest this week in the agricultural sector. On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held ralliesthroughout the country to protest against high interest rates. Television reports showed some of these protests stillcontinuing today, with farmers blockading banks with theirvehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo andParana. The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying toextricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by adeterioration in its trade balance. On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazilwas suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt toprivate banks. Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed andthe country is losing badly needed foreign exchange. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed andthe country is losing badly needed foreign exchange. Reuter',1 SHIP}

{0 'Construction workers today began buildinga 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador\'s jungle oilfieldsto a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude couldbe pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitryofficials said. They said it would take about two months and at least 15mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador toPuerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombianpipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia\'sPacific Ocean coast. The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed totransport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) ofEcuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said. The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room forEcuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadoreanenergy ministry official said. The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped byboat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domesticdemand. The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador toresume some of production, paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before. The tremor ruptured the country\'s main pipeline from jungleoilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the PacificOcean. Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before theearthquake. It would take about five months to repair thepipeline to Balao, government officials said. Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mlndlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake,energy ministry Javier Espinosa said. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

{0 'A greater than anticipated need,competitive prices and political motivations could be sparkingSoviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officialssaid. As rumors circulated through grain markets today that theSoviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S.corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factorsthat make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely. First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources saidrecent speculation has been that last year\'s Soviet grain cropbe revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mlnannounced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain. A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affectSoviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said. Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to theUSSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower itsArgentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mlntonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were alsocut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes. Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of thisyear\'s corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mlntonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR. \"Significant downside potential\" still exists for theArgentine crop, the official said, which will decrease theamount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow. \"If the Soviet needs are greater than we have beenthinking, then they might need more than what Argentina canprovide during the April to June period,\" he said. Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparkedSoviet buying. U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world marketearlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine cornfor 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Sovietsources said. \"This price difference makes American corn competitive,\"Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,told Reuters. Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely causethose prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. cornfutures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices havebottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said. Finally, some industry sources said that by buying theminimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grainsagreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping toconvince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat. In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretaryRichard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheatsubsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out. Reuter',1 GRAIN}
