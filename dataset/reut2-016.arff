{0 'Crude oil netback values in complexrefineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. lastFriday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore,according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline. The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S.relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularlygasoline, and support from crude oil prices. Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europerose substantially following strong gains in gasoline pricesthere. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel orthree pct from the previous week. In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct. Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts abarrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct. But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fellsharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ampledistillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices. Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week. For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values weremostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value ofKuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Lightfell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs. On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A.also jumped sharply, up 40 cts a barrel or 2.2 pct to 18.82dlrs on higher gasoline prices. Reuter',1 CRUDE}
{0 'Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe floating exchange rate system has not been as effective ashad been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalancesfrom emerging in the global economy. In remarks before the afternoon session of theInternational Monetary Fund\'s Interim Committee, Baker said hewas not suggesting that the system should be abandoned. \"But I do suggest,\" he said, \"that we need something to giveit more stability and to keep it headed in the right directionwhen the wind shifts.\" He said that indicators can serve \"as a kind of compass\" butadded that structural indicators can help focus attention onsome policies. Baker, however, said the IMF \"needs to move beyondmacroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators thatcan help focus attention on some of the policies of specificrelevance to the imbalances we face today.\" The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be givena more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- ArticleIV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was timefor the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMFsurveillance more relevant to national policymakers and thepublic. \"In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMFappraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use offollow-up reports on country actions to implement IMFrecommendations, and greater use of special consultationprocedures,\" he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device \"for movingbeyond rhetoric to action.\" He said they provide \"more structure to the system, andinduce more discipline and peer pressure into the process ofpolicy coordination.\" He said the Fund\'s procedures for surveillance need to bereviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators. \"This should be matter of priority for the executive board,\"he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternativemedium-term economic scenarios for countries that \"can help usfocus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, byidentifying options for addressing them and analyzing theimplications of these options.\" He said also that further work should be done on findingpaths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. \"If we are to take effective remedial action when there aresignificant deviations from an intended course, then we musthave more definitive ways of indentifying the right course forkey variables,\" he said.

{0 'Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability. Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce. A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York. The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said. Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets. \"Maybe they have some ideas or plans,\" said Chronowitz. \"Ifthey do, it\'s not evident.\" \"It looks like there\'s no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be. \"One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,\" as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said. \"I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It\'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that\'s what\'shappening,\" he said. The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.

{0 'Economists said that they doubt theFederal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despitehigher discount window borrowings in the latest two-weekstatement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday. Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mlndlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct. \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn\'t,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds. Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months. However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings. \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn\'t quite make it,\" saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday. Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed. The Fed took no market reserve management action lastThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It addedtemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday. Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged onTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday\'sovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs. \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy atthis time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzisaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders. \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch. He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday\'sWashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid. In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inWednesday\'s G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the United States and Japan. The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averageFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about wherethe rate has been since early November. \"I\'m not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan ofDean Witter. If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has justnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct fromsix to 6.10 pct previously. Reuter',1 INTEREST}

{0 'Economists said that they doubt theFederal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despitehigher discount window borrowings in the latest two-weekstatement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday. Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mlndlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct. \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn\'t,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds. Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months. However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings. \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn\'t quite make it,\" saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

{0 'Today\'s turmoil in the U.S. Financialmarkets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar\'swake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology thatis likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said. For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar\'s declineas the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fellsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up. But that confidence is now cracking as the financialmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker\'soften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse. \"Volcker\'s been saying for a long time that a dollarfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he\'s got it,\" saidDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washingtonfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, shortof further depreciation of the dollar. Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amidworries that the dollar\'s slide will rekindle inflation, scareaway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit. The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spikein interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average downby 33 points to 2339. Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called themarkets\' instability frightening. He believes economicfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"onceyou start the ball rolling it\'s difficult to stop.\" \"There\'s a stark possibility that you could get adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest ratesand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\" Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economicsin Washington, has been warning for a long time that thecontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare. \"We\'re still more or less on track for a hard landing... Butthe agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters. Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession. The stock market\'s reaction today and its sharp drop onMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about. The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen. Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar\'s latestweakness was the loss of credibility that central bankssuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from fallingbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set aspart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February. Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss ofconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announcedplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronicimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war. Many economists believe that long-run stability will notreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap isaddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in themassive budget deficit.

{0 'Bank of Japan sources said the bankhas no plans to cut its discount rate. They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japanduring the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lowerits discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feelany need for a cut at all. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reportersearlier today that some countries - those with strongcurrencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon tocall the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar\'srenewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked byremarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that thedollar\'s fall had been orderly. They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker\'scomments because he was referring to the dollar\'s fall sincethe Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,not the currency\'s recent movements. They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seizeon anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way orthe other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting moreweight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging marketstability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangersthat would arise from a further dollar fall because it wouldreduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting theU.S. And world economies, they said. In February and in March of this year, Japanese investorsreduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sourcessaid. Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view aboutcurrency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said. This is because the overall foreign exchange market is atriangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen anddollar/European currencies. At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries didnot want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they didnot object to the yen strengthening, they said. REUTER',1 INTEREST}

Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes andother industrial action in the state on April 7, workers\'compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details ofthe compromise package are not yet known.

{0 'A sugar mill which was thisnation\'s second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled fromMiami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic. The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,the company said. \"Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCOregrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar caneafter April 10,\" the mill warned planters earlier this week. Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteenmonths ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cookingoil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumerprices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwinghundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work. At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up toreceive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed awarehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound(45-kg) bags of sugar. \"We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.We have no money left to continue operations,\" Rigaud said. He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed anadditional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers. Rigaud blamed the mill\'s problems on an order by Duvaliertwo years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar. He said the government then began importing refined sugarat world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit andthe provisional military-civilian government that replacedDuvalier last year continued the policy. \"But now with all the smuggling even the state can\'t competewith smuggled Dominican refined sugar,\" Rigaud said. HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably abovethe usual minimum wage of three dlrs. It is generally estimated that every employed Haitiansupports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO\'s closing at aminimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.

{0 'Taiwan announced plans for another roundof import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before tradetalks with Washington which officials described as a move tohelp balance trade with the United States. Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry\'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington. \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates,\" he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinetthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cutby between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island\'slargest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei. Washington\'s deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985.

The board suspended offerings last week but because of itsurgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long itcould sustain, the sources added. Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have beenwaiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has hadtrouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to theKenyan port of Mombasa. Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis byholding up remittance of Uganda\'s hard currency earnings fromcoffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said. The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee moneyand President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penaltyfor such delays, it added. Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was thatcommercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings-- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in thecurrent coffee year, while the government had asked for 100billion. The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct ofannual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment. The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda\'s exportearnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows islikely to more than offset an expected increase in production.

Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operatingsubsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, areaffected, it said. But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 centsper share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repaymentson debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs. Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers weredemanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as aresult of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>. Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bondof more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil\'s1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY>. The bond almostmatches the damages awarded against Texaco. Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could beginto attach its assets to secure the judgment. Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cutTexaco\'s bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back tothe Texas courts. Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze allTexaco\'s obligations while it continued to appeal the merits ofthe Pennzoil lawsuit. \"Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bondissue and the larger dispute failed,\" James Kinnear, Texaco\'spresident and chief executive officer, told reporters. Kinnear said Pennzoil\'s disclosure in court papers onFriday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing untilthe end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11. Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cashbond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct ofearnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would notsell any assets, Kinnear said. Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter ofcredit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under11.1 billion dlrs, he added. Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said thecompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco onSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed forbankruptcy.

{0 'A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome\'s restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada\'s bid signals Dome\'s debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome\'s debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations. TransCanada\'s proposal \"amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome\'s restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\"said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary. TransCanada\'s announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada\'s announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,\" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada\'s proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility\'s announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada\'s. Gowland said TransCanada\'s offer is probably a fair pricefor the company\'s 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome\'s debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada\'s proposed offer. REUTER',1 ACQ}

{0 'Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan whichthey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to openits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves. Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ECcountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with thewillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanesegovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction toan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC couldraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligationsentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designedto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that ofthe U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC\'strade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February. In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billiondlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell onepct to 12.43 billion dlrs. In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France hasdecided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine. Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozenCoquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict applicationof French quality standards -- something EC states say oftenhappens to their own exports entering Japan. Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanesebanks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out incompetition for a Japanese telecommucations contract. However, British officials in London have said that thegovernment may have gone too far in implying that it would takeimmediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened. By contrast, West Germany, with the EC\'s most successfuleconomy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferringto rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its ownindustries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan. The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recentyears, substituting general calls for action by Japan to openits market with specific demands for moves in key areas. At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to endallegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines andspirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contractsfor the building of a new international airport, and tosimplify certification and safety checks on imported cars. EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, butoften the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariffbarriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount. They stress, however, that any action must be taken by theEC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action. One of the problems Britain could face if it were towithdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankerswould be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,they point out.

Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and thecourt said it would give its verdict within six weeks. \"However,that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court torefer questions on the interpretation and application of thelevy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,\" Pex added. Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not takeaccount of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean acompounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy inits own national currency than it received down the chain fromthe original producer of the grain. \"We would like the Business Administration Court in theHague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whetherthe Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but alsowhether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,\"Pex said. \"It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,but we have had no political help, and therefore have no optioneven though it could take years,\" Pex added. Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against thegrain levy because the bill the company received from thecommodity board included grain from a wide variety of originsand was therefore considered to be the best general basis for alegal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.

Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisalof the field\'s reserves and propose a development plan, hasestimated the field could be commercially developed at a costof some 700 mln crowns. Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lowerreserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown littleinterest in its development.

{0 'The five leading West German economicresearch institutes said the government should do more tostimulate economic growth and called for early introduction oftax cuts planned for 1990. In their joint spring report the institutes were dividedabout 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pctexpansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross nationalproduct grew 2.4 pct last year. But the report said all the institutes believed that \"moremust be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additionaljobs can be created.\" The institutes said any step which improved basic economicconditions should be taken as quickly as possible. \"From thispoint of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should bebrought forward.\" The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billionmarks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief fromthe tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks. However, the institutes criticised the government, not onlyfor the timing of the reform, but also because the question ofits financing had been left open. The government has not specified how the remaining 19billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies. The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn hadcaused uncertainty among companies and households as to whatexactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged aquick decision from the government. They also said the government should reduce taxpreferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged arestriction of state spending and called for no increase invalue-added tax. The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasingsubsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged. They referred specifically to a doubling of specialwritedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in apackage of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described thisas an increase in subsidies. The institutes said total subsidies, including taxpreferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risenfurther since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, itshould be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" tofinance the tax reform by cutting state handouts. The institutes said that if the government raised valueadded tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of thepositive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost. The report also noted that the government was progressingonly slowly with its plans to privatise state companies andsaid more deregulation was needed.

Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had anotherproposal from \"a substantial company\" and discussions with athird company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in astatement. The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada\'s bid,but did not identify the companies involved in talks. TransCanada, Canada\'s largest natural gas pipelineoperator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, commonand preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary whichwould own and operate Dome\'s assets. TransCanada said the offeris to Dome management, not to shareholders. Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs. Dome\'s statement said the TransCanada announcement \"violatedthe terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement enteredinto with prospective purchasers\" and was apparently timed toprevent Dome from considering other proposals. It said the TransCanada bid \"seems to require favourable andsubstantial taxation concessions from the federal andprovincial governments.\" But Dome added that its management andfinancial advisers will evaluate all proposals. TransCanada chief financial officer H.

The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonallyadjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged fromFebruary and close to the average for the last six months. The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pctin February. But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips andDrew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected arise in excise duties which affected the index in March lastyear. He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much intothe monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in Aprilwould take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct. Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers\' inputprices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factorssuch as a fall in industrial electricity costs. Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures wereslightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterlinghad not yet reduced input prices as much as expected. Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep inputcosts down over the next few months, although Tinker added thatlast year\'s fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of theyear-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return torises in the index rather than falls.

{0 'Top officials of leading industrialnations appear deeply worried that financial markets haveignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which theybelieve they strengthened in talks last week. Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that themarkets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severelydisrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of thepolicy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way toreassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with astatement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladurunderscored that by saying: \"I don\'t believe at all that theAmericans want a weaker dollar.\" West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said thedollar\'s latest rapid descent \"involves the risk -- now alreadya tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,leading to a renewed rise in interest rates.\" But there were signs too, that while policymakers fearedthe market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little theycould do until the economic picture changed, and currenciessettled into a stable pattern as a result. Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week\'ssemi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higherU.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar\'s rapiddescent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession. Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman toldtelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of drivingthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit. \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which wouldadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it woulddrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not(into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said. Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize thedollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintainedartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it isnot healthy.\" And resorting to higher interest rates could lead torecession, he said. Acknowledging the dollar\'s latest slide was now a fact oflife, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in oneor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\" But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said hemight rein in credit if the dollar\'s slide deepens. U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted itunderstood by markets the seven\'s commitments were genuine. \"The United States and the six major industrial countriesare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in theseagreements,\" Baker told the meetings. Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets whichwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a furtherdecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed tostabilizing currencies at current levels. Last week\'s statement from the seven reaffirmed a February22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreedto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fightprotectionism. West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulatedomestic demand and lead a global upturn. Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan\'spromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget. The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a majoraction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stablecurrencies applied to today\'s exchange rates and not those atthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher. The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within rangesbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, giventhe policy commitments summarized in this statement.\" Now they accept the dollar\'s lower level, especiallyagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistentwith the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed theview that around current levels their currencies are withinranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week\'sstatement read. Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets werefocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japanrather than prospective policy changes. European monetarysources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meantbusiness with its commitment to cut the budget deficit. Reuter',1 DLR}

{0 'Senate Finance Committee ChairmanLloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries tomake a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cutinterest rates. \"I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to betrying to do is to get the other major industrial nations thatare involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,\"Bentsen told NBC Television\'s \"Meet the Press.\" Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take \"billions offthe debt service of the Latin countries\" and help easeprotectionist pressures in the industrial countries. Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured torevalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. \"You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,enormous trade surplus, and we\'ve had very little cooperationthere,\" he said. Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told thesame television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had notfallen enough against the currencies of some countries. \"I think that more does have to be done there innegotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs(newly industrialized countries),\" he said. Darman said such negotiations with newly industrializedcountries were underway privately. Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agreeon a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22billion dlrs in new revenues. The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would beconsidered by Congress, including an extension of the telephonetax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes. Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that itwould not happen without President Reagan\'s support. Darman called for a \"top level negotiation\" between the WhiteHouse and Congress on a budget compromise that would includeasset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-classentitlement programs, \"a reasonable, steady rate of growth indefense\" and reform of the budget process.

{0 'A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome\'s restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada\'s bid signals Dome\'s debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome\'s debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations. TransCanada\'s proposal \"amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome\'s restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\"said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary. TransCanada\'s announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added. \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada\'s announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,\" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada\'s proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility\'s announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada\'s. Gowland said TransCanada\'s offer is probably a fair pricefor the company\'s 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome\'s debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada\'s proposed offer. Reuter',1 ACQ}
{0 'Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he hasraised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs eachfrom 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seekingto 29.1 mln from all those not already owned. In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by hisMTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the prorationperiod will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer hadbeen scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said hehad received a \"negligible\" number of shares in response to theoffer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate. Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars\' 30 mlncommon shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on aprimary basis. Last week, Caesars\' board approved a recapitalization planas an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholderswould receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subjectto approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held inJune. The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mlndlrs in debt to finance the payout. Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that theamended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares togive him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and onthe arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by NewJersey and Nevada gaming authorities. He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring allof Caesars\' shares and if successful would be followed by amerger transaction. Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shareshe is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis. He said he still has received only a \"negligible\" number ofshares in response to his tender. In a letter to Caesars\' chairman Henry Gluck included inthe statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing toincrease the price of his offer. Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully inplace. Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> has now deliveredto him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasingdividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS HoldingCorp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition. He said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, which leads asyndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlrmargin facility, believes it will be able to arrange forfurther commitments under the margin facility to advance up toan additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit thepurchase of shares under the offer. Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted intoSeries A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby anindependent investment baking firm. He said \"To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdharesare purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive acombination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a valueof 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.\" Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior toCaesars\' recapitalization. Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gamingofficials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatoryprocess required for regulatory approval, a process that italready underway in New Jersey. He said his offer has been extended based on the likelyduration of the regulatory process. He said he intends to further extend the offer if theapproval process is not completed by the expiration date. Reuter',1 ACQ}

Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiarysaid, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice aproposal to include these costs in the company\'s most recentpurchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing. Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denialruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternativefiling if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing toinclude the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA orconsolidates this issue in the pipeline\'s general rate filingand permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one. The company said the alternative filing seeks to recoverabout 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline\'s non-gas salescommodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based onrecovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,beginning April 1, 1987. Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipelinecommodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln. The company said it orginially sought to include thesecosts in its PGA since the payments to products resulted inalmost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and werenot related to take-or-pay buyout costs. It explained this interpretation was based on FERC\'s April10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-paybuyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filingunder the Natural Gas Act. As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average pricepaid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrsper mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April1985.

{0 'Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan whichthey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to openits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves. Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ECcountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with thewillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanesegovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction toan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC couldraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligationsentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designedto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that ofthe U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC\'strade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February.

{0 'The European Community (EC) haseffectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open itsmarket to imports before it decides on possible toughretaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said. They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26to review the state of trade relations between the two sides. The EC executive commission was asked by representatives ofmember states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some ECpledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are\"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.\" Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposingstiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japaneseexports. The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would bediscussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministerson April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepareproposals for possible retaliatory action. They said the commission has powers to take some limitedaction before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japaneseexports of electrical, photographic and other goods beingdiverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves. In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how toprevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as aresult of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obligesthem gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods. Japan\'s trade surplus with the Community has grownsteadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March. Reuter',1 TRADE}

Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry\'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington. \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates,\" he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinetthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cutby between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island\'slargest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei. Washington\'s deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985.

{0 'National Westminster Bank USA saidhigher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantialincrease in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise infirst-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reporteda year earlier. The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction ofincome as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual. Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly tomiddle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But someof these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates. Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losseswas 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986. Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at theend of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrsof loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status. The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual forthe remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reducedby about 4.9 mln dlrs.

At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM\'s first-quarter net income easilytopped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from aneven dollar to 1.20 dlrs. Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM\'sperformance. But they indicated that IBM\'s chances for a fullrecovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not befelt until later in the year. These include the success of IBM\'s new personal computerline, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,which will begin volume shipments in July. In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of itsearly-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves willemerge as the year progresses. Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F.

{0 'GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-WarnerCorp\'s valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts tobe preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company. Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill LynchCapital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for89 pct of Borg-Warner\'s common stock, and a package of cash andsecurities for the balance. Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8. \"I think it\'s (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming inwith another bid,\" said one analyst, who values the company at51 or 52 dlrs per share. GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct ofBorg-Warner\'s stock. \"You\'re in a cat and mouse game on how you\'re going to upthe price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you haveto. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we\'re lookingat it - that it\'s worth more,\" Pershing and Co analyst RichardHenderson said. Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share. GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. MerrillLynch officials did not return phone calls. Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heymansought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plasticsbusiness. The rigid plastics are used in such things astelephones, computer terminals, and appliances. \"Where the heck can you buy a world class chemicaloperation these days,\" said Henderson. \"He\'s (Heyman\'s) got the bucks. He\'s a heavy hitter, and hedoes not like to get pushed around,\" said Henderson. GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeoverof the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAFdid not win the company, it made a substantial gain on itsinvestment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into itsBorg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offerand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company wouldgive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. \"It\'s a win-win situation,\" said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would beforthcoming shortly. \"I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in thisbook,\" he said. Borg-Warner\'s other businesses include automotive parts,protective services, which includes Wells Fargo securityguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who followsGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, itwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 pershare. \"I think there\'s a probability he goes up in price,\" saidRose. Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heymanwould do. \"Sam\'s a low-risk, high-return player.\" \"Is he trying to build a major industrial chemicalenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,\" Rosesaid. Analysts said Borg-Warner\'s chemical business would addearnings momentum to GAF. \"I worked out that paying as much as50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, ifthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,\" said JohnHenry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner\'s chemical and plastics business provided 1986operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billiondlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and netearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986. \"The Borg chemical business is great,\" said Rose, addingits only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co <MCT> and DowChemical Co <DOW>.

{0 'Major U.S. banks may lift primelending rates again within days due to recent increases intheir borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve isnudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said. In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, mostbanks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their owncost of money. That spread has narrowed again. \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct isjustified because the spread between banks\' cost of funds andthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of apercentage point. He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentagepoints since last October until it fell below one point andtriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks. \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soonas this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. \"We\'ve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in thenear future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and fundingcosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the primebecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loandemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintainrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates. Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures liftshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. Hesaid \"if there is widespread belief money market rates willstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\" Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep adollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollarfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traderssaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar. In addition to buying dollars outright, another way tostabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.interest rates higher relative to overseas rates. Based particularly on the Fed\'s reserve management actionson Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has becomeclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressurein the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\" Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interestrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculationthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy. That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in themarket than most economists had expected. On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in smallamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreementswith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one anotherhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pcttoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlrround of customer repurchase agreements. \"The Fed\'s actions on Friday and today show that it isoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"said Jones of Lanston. \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on theneed to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it ismerely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have amajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policyovertly at some point.\" Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates bybecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, withinfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct. Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct mightwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts tofurther aid the dollar. Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime ratemay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year\'s end. \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tighteningpolicy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp.

In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, mostbanks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their owncost of money. That spread has narrowed again. \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct isjustified because the spread between banks\' cost of funds andthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of apercentage point. He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentagepoints since last October until it fell below one point andtriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks. \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soonas this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. \"We\'ve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in thenear future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and fundingcosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the primebecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loandemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintainrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates. Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures liftshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. Hesaid \"if there is widespread belief money market rates willstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\" Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep adollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollarfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traderssaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar. In addition to buying dollars outright, another way tostabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.interest rates higher relative to overseas rates. Based particularly on the Fed\'s reserve management actionson Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has becomeclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressurein the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\" Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interestrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculationthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy. That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in themarket than most economists had expected. On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in smallamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreementswith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one anotherhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pcttoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlrround of customer repurchase agreements. \"The Fed\'s actions on Friday and today show that it isoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"said Jones of Lanston. \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on theneed to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it ismerely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have amajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policyovertly at some point.\" Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates bybecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, withinfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct. Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct mightwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts tofurther aid the dollar. Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime ratemay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year\'s end. \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tighteningpolicy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. Hesaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressuresabate will show whether or not it is firming policy. Reuter',1 MONEY-FX}

The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted onimports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice sinceCommerce\'s preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said. Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty. Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.supply, Vastagh said.

The company last week had stated that a number of domesticand international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oilshipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings. Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks toldTexaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texacosaid in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P.Morgan Co\'s <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for depositsto cover transactions, it said. The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arosefrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. SupremeCourt in Texaco\'s ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> overthe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984. The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco\'splea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. \"Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as theycould,\" Elton said. But following Monday\'s Supreme Courtruling, Texaco\'s suppliers began demanding cash and haltingsupplies. \"It wasn\'t until last Wednesday that it turned into anavalanche,\" he said. \"Supplies were cut to the point where wecould not run the system at anywhere near capacity.\" He said less than half of Texaco\'s oil supplies had been injeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortagesby mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Eltonsaid. It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,Occidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, andAtlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards. The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> lastweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates todaysaid, \"a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go onsupplying.

Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange andgained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto StockExchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as highas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Domehas normally moved by only a few cents per day. TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlrCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome\'s assets, butDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also stilltalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify. Market analysts today said the other two firms are believedto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterdaystressed that its bid is \"a Canadian solution to the financialdifficulties of Dome Petroleum.\" \"The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont<DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadianinterest in 1975 and could be getting back in,\" said Wilf Gobertof Peters and Co Ltd. David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that BritishPetroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despiteBP\'s 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percentof Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own. Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has saidin recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talkswith Dome. Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as \"awfullyoptimistic,\" given TransCanada\'s offer to give current Domeshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10dlrs Canadian per common share. Under the offer, current Dome common and preferredshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, whichwould own and operate all Dome\'s former assets. TransCanadawould own 80 pct. However, Bryson said the market may be looking at thepotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. \"TheTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,\"he said. Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is \"at theupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.\" The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome\'s creditors 3.87billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with anotherone billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available tosecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above acertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level. Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billionCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took onseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the companywanted to expand. \"There has been speculation that Dome\'s assets are capableof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on thatbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,\"Gobert said. Dome\'s debt troubles have often obscured the fact that itis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holdsreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billioncubic feet of natural gas. The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acresof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, theheart of Canada\'s oil industry. Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres ofland across Canada. The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrsCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.).

{0 'Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER>subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said itcould realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or notthe deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealermanager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed. But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mlndlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another partyholding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct. The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in anytender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealermanager services or for break-up of the deal. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group ofinvestors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tenderoffer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock. The company\'s board has approved the plan, which wasintended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp. Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series Apreferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr ashare exercise price before the merger is effective, it said. Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possibleleveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December. At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it wouldconsider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it saidit was told the company had decided against a buyout. But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr ashare proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said. Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warnermanagement was asked not to take part in the new deal and itwas conditioned upon payment of the fees. In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will alsoget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses inthe tender offer. Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warneras a subsidiary with its current officers keeping theirpositions. But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it isconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner\'s assets to a number ofsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger. All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal. Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debtof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said. To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects toborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mlndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs ofnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynchand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes toMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs ofsubordinated discount debentures.

{0 'South Korea has decided on major changesin its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducingthe growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding atrade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister KimMahn-je said. Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exportscould make South Korea too reliant on exports, increasenflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, whichmeans abandoning Seoul\'s goal of rapidly reducing its foreigndebt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings. Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said thecurrent account surplus, previously expected to exceed eightbillion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billiondlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisationand rationalising exports. He said Seoul would try to limit its current accountsurplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next fewyears, although trade volume would continue to grow. \"This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP(gross national product) from the current five pct level tothree pct by 1991,\" he added. Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea\'s foreigndebt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the endof 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5billion dlrs at end-1986. \"But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected toremain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lowerthan the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,\" he said. The policy change was announced two days before thescheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigefor talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae. South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateraltrade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from4.3 billion dlrs in 1985. Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swingin South Korea\'s current account to a surplus of 2.06 billiondlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mlndlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs. The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, rawmaterials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said. \"The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), areconsiderable incentives given to increase imports,\" Koo said. Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.\"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Koreancurrency continues to rise in value,\" he said.

{0 'Basic reform of Japan\'s protected farmsector is a key to shifting its economy away from export todomestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its tradesurplus, securities analysts said. The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs andquotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, andsheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, theysaid. \"In economic terms, reform would be a plus,\" said ChristopherChew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co. The ultimate cost of the existing system is food pricestwice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,The analysts said. Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of theaverage household\'s budget and roughly 10 pct of the grossnational product (GNP), according to a study by Chew. Reducing these prices could increase household spendingpower by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent onproducts which would have a more direct impact in boostingdomestic growth, it added. \"There\'s a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyosaid. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\" Direct central government subsidies to the farm sectoramount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independentestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted. Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farmon weekends to put their land up for sale for residentialdevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,economists said. \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in theexpansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professorat Kyoto Gakuen University. Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reformto shift some of the burden of trade friction and economicrestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto thefarm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you reallywant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not toraise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" BumpeiOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers\'Associations told a recent press conference. External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seekremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their tradedeficits with Japan. But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain wellentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said. Although the full-time farm population is falling and thereare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urbanconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent onfarm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth severalcity votes due to the pattern of constituency borders. The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reformplan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,the analysts said. Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept thetraditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay fornational food security, they said. Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed toimport liberalisation, but are more flexible about reformsaimed at stepping up productivity, they said. Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specificpressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew. REUTER',1 TRADE}

{0 'President Reagan today is toannounce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports toretaliate for what he calls Japan\'s failure to end its unfairpractices in semiconductor trade. The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel ofexperts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffson certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computorsand television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to SantaBarbara, where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed tofull enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provideAmerican industry with free and fair trade opportunities.\" He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored thepact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in worldmarkets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the Marchannouncement to alter Reagan\'s plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday: \"wedo not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind ofaction that requires meaningful action.\" Reagan\'s move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,with last year\'s hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president toretaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation, saying it would preventnegotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, thatexisting law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese wasas much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did notneed any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoringthe semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before theresults showed up. U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring ofJapanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries andWestern Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that theJapanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it wouldfile a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade(GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation hadviolated the regulations of the global trading group and wouldapprove compensation or Japanese retaliation. U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan wouldretaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war withthe United States. Reuter',1 TRADE}

{0 'Amoco Corp is apparently the successfulbidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to apublished report. The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to thenegotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night withTransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome\'s assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were availableand a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amocohad emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Domecould be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe andMail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available forcomment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Domesaid it was also in talks with two other companies, but refusedto identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco andExxon Corp\'s <XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary inCanada. British Petroleum PLC <BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD>have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured bythe federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney\'s government appears to wantto avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the governmentgave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks toencourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts andofficials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to runafoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada isasking for tax concessions from a federal government that istrying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreignoil company a dominant position in Canada\'s oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada\'s largest energy company,with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-basedAmoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs.

Yeutter, on the NBC program \"Today,\" said the United Statesdid not want to terminate the agreement and would dropthe tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement. He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officialsthey were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would taketime to monitor any compliance. Asked how long that would take, he said \"We want to see apattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that wouldtake a few weeks.\" Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumerimpact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goodsbecause the items selected are also readily available fromother countries and manufacturers. He said he did not think Japan would retaliate. \"It seems to me it is not in the interests of either countryto get in an escalating conflict. The Japanese understand thatfull well,\" Yeutter said.

Private-sector economists emphasized that the CommerceDepartment was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billiondlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis. A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in theforeign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealerssaid, that the underlying trade deficit for February had beenrevised downward.

{0 'The tough trade sanctions PresidentReagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot acrossJapan\'s bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair tradepractices worldwide, U.S. officials said. But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at BrookingsInstitution, a think tank, said \"a shot across their bow canoften result in a shot in our stern.\" He said it left the United States open to retaliation. The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan orderedon 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congressthat a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,and no new protectionist legislation is needed. In the past year tough trade action had been taken againstthe European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beerand wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters thetariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a \"serious signal\"to other nations on the need for fair trade practices. Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honoran agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets atless than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. Thetariffs were placed on items which were available from othersources so there would be little effect on the Americanconsumer, Fitzwater said. Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action- especially against Japan - to end global unfair tradepractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit. The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would. The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for aboutone-third of America\'s overall deficit. But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said thepresident is ready to fight them all. Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regretthat these actions are necessary,\" but that the health andvitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential toAmerican competitiveness in world markets. \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair tradingpractices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his Californiavacation home at Santa Barbara.

{0 'U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigepraised South Korea\'s new surplus-cutting trade policies butwarned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul\'s marketliberalisation efforts falter or fail. In a press conference after talks with South Koreanleaders, Baldrige called the government\'s announced intentionto regulate exports and boost imports \"a very, very importantstep, the right direction for the Korean government to take.\" The government adopted the new policies last week in thehope of heading off a trade war with the U.S. Baldrige said the policies \"showed an understanding of thefact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing byexports alone.\" \"There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growthbegins to take more of the load,\" he said. South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus withWashington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars andconsumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billiondlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year. Baldrige said Seoul\'s package of measures was \"broad enoughand comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken forliberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, ifthe government is willing to follow through.\" \"We will be watching the implementation of this new policydirection very closely,\" he said. \"Because of the protectionismgrowing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does notkeep on the same path ... Of steadily increasingliberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turnbackward, I\'m as sure as I\'m standing here that we\'d seeprotectionist movement in the U.S.\" Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister RhaWoong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specificproduct categories. These included service industries, which he said were stilltoo much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers andcars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing thetariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make themsell for up to three times their American prices. \"We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there\'sgoing to be trouble somewhere down the road,\" he said. \"We arejust pointing this out.\" Asked if Seoul\'s measures could succeed without arevaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging formonths, Baldrige declined to comment. \"We don\'t have any targetfor any particular currency, but we do feel that currenciesaround the world, if we are going to be successful as a worldeconomy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the variouseconomies involved,\" he said. Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha\'s proposal forcooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures inthird countries. The American government would be pleased toencourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added. Commenting on President Reagan\'s decision to increasetariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige saidWashington\'s trade problems with Japan were not comparable toits difficulties with South Korea. \"I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,\"he said. \"It\'s a firm attitude. We don\'t get anything fornothing or just by asking for it. \"But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and theyusually end up with something good happening at the end thatboth countries live up to.\" REUTER',1 TRADE}

Economic and Social Commission forAsia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the pricefall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, whichfound it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region. Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimatedto have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilledin Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985. The report said <Thai Shell Exploration and Production CoLtd>, a unit of the <Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30pct cut in exploration and production spending last year. To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reducedpetroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes. Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pctto cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regionalexporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran.Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in1986 from 40 billion the previous year. Indonesia\'s export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said. Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion,China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion. However, Asian importers saved between eight and ninebillion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably easedtheir balance of payments.

{0 'The World Bank has suggested Indiashould move to a more open economy by gradually removing mostgovernment controls on industry and adopting a liberal externaltrade policy with reduced levels of protection. A confidential \"executive summary\" of a draft Bank report onthe Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggestsliberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exportsof Indian goods by making them more competitive. The summary said, \"These reforms would result in (domestic)prices much more in line with world prices than is true today,and in a greater degree of import competition and exportrivalry than the nation has ever seen.\" The summary said foreign trade must play a key role inIndia\'s transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberalimports of capital goods would help modernise the economy andexpose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exportswould provide the foreign exchange for imports. \"The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the presentprinciple of unlimited protection for all indigenouslyavailable products and to recognise the role of actual orpotential competition from imports as a source of discipline onthe prices and costs of public and private sector domesticmanufacturers,\" the summary said. An Indian official told Reuters the government wasdiscussing the report with the Bank. A final report with somechanges was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to givefurther details. The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank\'sfinal report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discussaid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June. The summary said India\'s gross domestic product (gdp) grewat an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and1986/87, which ended in March. It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct ofgdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed bynational savings, mainly from the private sector. India\'s trade deficit is officially said to have narrowedto 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.

{0 'U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigepraised South Korea\'s new surplus-cutting trade policies butwarned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul\'s marketliberalisation efforts falter or fail. In a press conference after talks with South Koreanleaders, Baldrige called the government\'s announced intentionto regulate exports and boost imports \"a very, very importantstep, the right direction for the Korean government to take.\" The government adopted the new policies last week in thehope of heading off a trade war with the U.S. Baldrige said the policies \"showed an understanding of thefact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing byexports alone.\" \"There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growthbegins to take more of the load,\" he said. South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus withWashington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars andconsumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billiondlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year. Baldrige said Seoul\'s package of measures was \"broad enoughand comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken forliberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, ifthe government is willing to follow through.\" \"We will be watching the implementation of this new policydirection very closely,\" he said. \"Because of the protectionismgrowing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does notkeep on the same path ... Of steadily increasingliberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turnbackward, I\'m as sure as I\'m standing here that we\'d seeprotectionist movement in the U.S.\" Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister RhaWoong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specificproduct categories. These included service industries, which he said were stilltoo much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers andcars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing thetariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make themsell for up to three times their American prices. \"We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there\'sgoing to be trouble somewhere down the road,\" he said. \"We arejust pointing this out.\" Asked if Seoul\'s measures could succeed without arevaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging formonths, Baldrige declined to comment. \"We don\'t have any targetfor any particular currency, but we do feel that currenciesaround the world, if we are going to be successful as a worldeconomy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the variouseconomies involved,\" he said. Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha\'s proposal forcooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures inthird countries. The American government would be pleased toencourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added. Commenting on President Reagan\'s decision to increasetariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige saidWashington\'s trade problems with Japan were not comparable toits difficulties with South Korea. \"I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,\"he said. \"It\'s a firm attitude.

Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N.Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the currentUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said Britain is committed to resisting and combattingprotectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services. Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets,remove measures distorting free trade in services and provideprotection for intellectual property rights. He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economicpolicies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stablecurrency relationships. Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surplusesand falling commodity prices in recent years, is oversubsidised and over protected. But the problem of farmsurpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it ispolitically difficult for any government to reverse the trendof growing farm subsidies. \"This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection ofagriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need thesustained application of all our energy and our imagination tofind solutions,\" Howe said.

It will be discussed soon by officials of the FinanceMinistry, the Central Bank and the Council for EconomicPlanning and Development before being submitted to the cabinetfor final approval, he said. \"This is the first ambitious proposal with governmentinitiatives to encourage our businessmen to invest in America,\"Lee said. He said government incentives to prospective Taiwaneseinvestors would include bank loans and a five-year income taxholiday. Applications for investing in the U.S. Would also besimplified. A ministry spokesman told reporters the proposed investmentwould be helpful in creating job opportunities for Americansand avoiding U.S. Import quotas or restrictions on Taiwaneseproducts. The plan will also help reduce Taiwan\'s trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in1986, up from 10.2 billion in 1985, the spokesman said. The rising surplus has enabled Taiwan to accumulate some 54billion U.S. Dlrs in foreign exchange reserves. Economists described the proposal as a significant step bythe government to head off U.S. Protectionism. \"Time is running out for us. Taiwan has lagged far behindJapan and South Korea in encouraging its businessmen to investabroad,\" said Hou Chia-chi, economics professor at SoochowUniversity. REUTER',1 TRADE}

Chief executive William James told reporters after theannual meeting that \"I would hope that the loss for the yearcertainly wouldn\'t be a high as the loss for the first quarter.In other words we are going to make money from here on in.\" Falconbridge last year made a first quarter operating lossof 17.1 mln dlrs and a full-year operating loss of 15.5 mlndlrs. James said currency losses tied to the stronger Canadiandollar resulted for about eight mln dlrs of the first quarteroperating loss. Falconbridge records its cash and accountsreceivable in U.S. dollars, with the Canadian dollar equivalentdecreasing as the U.S. dollar falls. He said the first quarter loss also stemmed from weakernickel and ferronickel prices and lower production at thecompany\'s Sudbury, Ontario nickel operations and at some KiddCreek operations. Falconbridge anticipates higher productionthrough the rest of the year and higher average prices thisyear for precious metals, James added, without elaborating. Falconbridge has no immediate plans for furtherdivestments, James said in reply to reporters\' inquiries. Thecompany sold several mining subsidiaries last year to help paydown debt from its January, 1986 acquisition of Kidd CreekMines Ltd from Canada Development Corp <CDC.TO>. He said Falconbridge\'s debt now totaled about one billiondlrs, down from 1.37 billion dlrs at the time of the Kidd Creekbuy. James said he could not assess the impact of Amoco Corp<AN>\'s proposed acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>. Dome\'s23 pct-owned Dome Mines Ltd <DM> owns 21 pct of Falconbridge. Asked by reporters if Falconbridge preferred competing Domebidder, Calgary, Alberta-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd toChicago-based Amoco, James replied, \"It makes no difference tome...whoever takes it over is fine by us.\" He told shareholders that Falconbridges\' planned capitalexpenditures this year would decline to 134 mln dlrs from 160mln dlrs last year.

{0 'TransCanada PipeLines Ltd deniedreports that it raised its offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>to 5.5 billion Canadian dlrs from 4.3 billion. A report on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) late lastnight said TransCanada\'s new bid was rejected by Dome, whichhas accepted a 5.1 billion dlr bid from Amoco Corp <AN>. \"We still want to acquire Dome\'s assets and are prepared tonegotiate. However, we have not presented a new proposal to thecompany since April 16 and Dome has refused to negotiate withTransCanada since that date,\" said TransCanada president GeraldMaier. TransCanada said its proposal consists of two parts -- 4.5billion dlrs in cash and securities and one billion dlrs ofpayments to creditors based on future profits. Last week, TransCanada valued the first part of its offerat 4.3 billion dlrs, but a spokesman today said the companyincreased the estimated value of that part to 4.5 billion dlrsafter the recent gain in Dome\'s stock. Dome was halted today on the Toronto Stock Exchange pendingclarification of TransCanada\'s offer. It last traded at 1.70dlrs per share. Two weeks ago, before TransCanada\'s offer, Dometraded at about 1.10 dlrs per share. Reuter',1 ACQ}
