Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeksof negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) thatthere would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactionsand a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other typesof business. The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions todistribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determinethe kwacha\'s exchange rate, but these were suspended at the endof January. President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he wassuspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluationand violent fluctations of the exchange rate which hadresulted. Business and banking sources said another reason forsuspending the auction was that the central bank was low onforeign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successfulbidders. The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction systemwas first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later. Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate ofabout nine kwacha per dollar. REUTER',1 MONEY-FX}

{0 'Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oilproducers, announced today, are aimed at encouragingdevelopments in the North Sea to go ahead and boostopportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the InlandRevenue said in a post-budget statement. Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announcedin his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companieswill be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on anindividual field itself, when its income stream began, but wasnot immediately available against other developmentexpenditure, the statement said. The new relief will apply to fields outside the southernbasin for which developmentconsent is first given on or after today, and will improve thepost-tax economics of new developments and encourage companiesto proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said. Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allowcertain expenditure on oil related research which does not atpresent qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRTliability. This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on theU.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in aparticular field within three years of being incurred, to beallowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the InlandRevenue said. This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs morein line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned toencourage general research into ways of reducing fielddevelopment costs, it said. In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mlnstg a year, it calculated. The Inland Revenue statement also included other technicalmeasures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech. These included measures to allow companies to balance theirshares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in twopast periods of allowance utilisation. Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefswere announced, while there were also ammendments on rules oncorporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to theso-called \"ring fence\" of activities in the U.K. And itscontinental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions forthe implementation of measures announced in November, it said. Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokersWood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefson PRT would help the depressed offshore industry. He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief wouldfavour chances that development of smaller North Sea fieldssuch Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward. Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fieldsmight also be encouraged, he said. Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshoreconstruction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offsunder the price slump of more than 50 pct last year. He pointed out that the relief only applies to thedevelopment of new fields outside the Southern Basin. This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in thecentral and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper thanin the south and thus have greater capital and labourrequirements as the waters are deeper than in the south. He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditurewould help fundamental research in the oil industry, althoughthe benefits of this research would not be seen for severalyear. REUTER',1 CRUDE}

Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost theirstake to 40 pct through indirect holdings. The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject toclose discussions within the government due to legal queriesover the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministryofficial said. Although bought by French citizens they are managed byforeign banks <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and<Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled byAlgemene Bank Nederland NV <ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.

APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference acapital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, butdeclined to give details or say how an increase would affectforeign stakes in CGCT. In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales ofthree billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs. A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committedto investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and productionplants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT toproduce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it toFrench standards.

{0 'British bank base lending rates arelikely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct thisweek following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set intoday\'s 1987 budget, bank analysts said. The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson\'s budget as cautious, a quality which currency and moneymarkets had already started to reward. Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and moneymarket interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budgetmeasures came through, the analysts said. Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said heexpected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow. \"This is very much a safety-first budget in order to getinterest rates down,\" he said. Bootle said the money markets had almost entirelydiscounted such a one point cut, with the key three monthinterbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, andit would be rather conservative for banks to go for ahalf-point cut now. Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts. \"This budget is designed to please both the markets and theelectorate. The implications for interest rates are veryfavourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and anothersuch cut before the end of the week,\" Simmonds said. Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, hesaid Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cutin income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.\"There is no real need to boost private consumption,\" he said. National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern saidthe lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased thelikelihood of an early one-point base rate cut. Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve thesharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-pointbase rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget small-print was convincing, \"and Isuspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see onepoint off base rates by the end of this week,\" Kern said. Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pavethe way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.This would help achieve Lawson\'s lower than expected consumerprice inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said. U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, moneyand government bonds (gilts) markets. But building societies said they would not cut lendingrates until base rates had fallen by one full point. REUTER',1 INTEREST}

Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that\"although we have made gains in energy security in the last sixyears, this report shows that there is justification fornational concern both over declining competitiveness of ourdomestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.\" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report\'s options to ease U.S. reliance on foreignoil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing adetermination that the country never again become captive to aforeign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages andsharp prices increases of the 1970s.

Venezuela\'s energy and mines minister arturo hernandezgrisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsabuys 50 pct of champlin\'s corpus christi refinery, as \"one morestep in the maturation and presence of our oil industry inworld markets.\" union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement willbe beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source ofsupply with a modern refinery and access to markets. \"we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a timeof protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there areclear benefits to both sides,\" he said. Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even withan oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily overthe years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelanheavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities andobtain a competitive product yield. \"therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been aconsideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seenwhat such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impacton today\'s agreement,\" adams said. He said the refinery could run crude as heavy asvenezuela\'s bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without anydifficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier dietto take advantage of bigger margins. The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd ofvenezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pctyield of white products. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

{0 'The International Cocoa Organization,ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draftproposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said. The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director KobenaErbynn, represented a compromise between producer, EuropeanCommunity, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stockshould operate, they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First, thebuffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa ratherthan using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said. Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would befree to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said. The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa couldcomprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the thirdlaid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock managerwould pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to beset by a formula, the delegates said. After the plan was presented, working group delegates metbriefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and allconsumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reactionto the scheme and will respond to it when the working groupmeets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base towork from, one consumer delegate said. Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point fornegotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change. Reuter',1 COCOA}

They said issues to be discussed by the ministers fromBahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United ArabEmirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bankgovernors on a common currency exchange rate. The governors agreed in January on a denominator on whichto base currencies of the six states. Any decision will beforwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due inSaudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. SaudiArabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to theInternational Monetary Fund\'s basket of currencies -- thespecial drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, whileKuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised byitself. The denominator chosen by central bank governors has notbeen disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to belinked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket.

A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expectedtomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. Afollow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week. \"Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,\" Peter Fellner,U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. \"It wasa very, very prudent fiscal budget.\" Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was awell-balanced budget within the confines of the government\'sphilosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat. Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscalside, but offered nothing new on monetary policy. As was widely expected, Lawson split his \"fiscal adjustment\"between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stgfrom 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to27 pct. The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, waskept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broadSterling M3 aggregate was dropped. Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way fora half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but theauthorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a fullone-point cut tomorrow. \"The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action whichit will have to reverse later,\" Jeffrey said, though he added afurther half-point cut was quite possible in the near future. The main worry from today\'s speech is the outlook forinflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy containedin it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said. Holt noted the \"rather loose\" inflation forecast of 4.0 pctat end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to resultfrom the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern. \"A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,\"he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back offalling base rates would have an offsetting impact oninflation. The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence butit was \"not a good budget for inflation,\" he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more aboutthe dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was nottoo concerned about a revival of inflation. Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the\"leading edge\" of monetary policy, but said the authorities werelikely to be extremely cautious on this front. He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interestrates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed anysigns of excessive weakness. Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibilityof the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts. Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility bythe favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecastto be 4.0 billion stg. But analysts said the Budget speech did not give anyclear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,which has to be held before June, 1988. Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that thebenefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raiseduties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately. But others said it kept several options open and it was notpossible to deduce too much from it.

{0 'Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almostthree points today as its vice chairman and an investment groupproposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company. However, several arbitragers said they would shy away fromthe stock at its current price levels since it is unclear howhigh bidding for the company would go and whether the companywould agree to a takeover. \"There are too many uncertainties,\" said one arbitrager. Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4. Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett CapitalInc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating theywere committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast companyand were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150dlrs per share. The company responded that the proposal would be submittedto the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet beenmade on a sale of the company. \"Someone\'s betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs pershare),\" said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at currentlevels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per sharerange. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this levelwould be chancy since it will take a long time for anytransaction to be completed because of regulatory approvalsnecessary for the broadcast properites. Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billiondlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejectedthe bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternativessuch as restructuring. Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,which has two large shareholders in an investment group led byRobert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American FinancialCorp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50years ago, has about 12 pct. Lindner last week told the Securities and ExchangeCommission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft. \"I could see if things got really crazy that it might gofor 175 (dlrs per share),\" said one arbitrager, but hespeculated it probably would not even be taken over for morethan a price in the 160s. Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but hespeculated the investor would not really be interested inrunning the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment. Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, saidhe had speculated the company might be considering a leveragedbuyout. \"Ideally, you\'d have to break this thing up to satisfy allthe interests involved,\" he said, adding the two largestshareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft. He said the highest takeover price he calculated for thecompany has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highestestimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said thelatter would be based on more optimistic expectations for thebroadcast industry. Reuter',1 ACQ}

The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except theagro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fallin January, while construction and civil engineeringexperienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over thenext few months. Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, inparticular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said. Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exceptionof the agro-food industry, improved substantially. In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised lastmonths. Production rose in all sectors except agriculturalmachinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and shipconstruction, where it declined. The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn inactivity in February, with both domestic and export ordersrising.

{0 'The Bank of France expects a continuedrevival in short-term industrial activity, but the outlook forany improvement in France\'s record 10.9 pct unemployment rateremains bleak, the Bank of France said in its monthly review. The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except theagro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fallin January, while construction and civil engineeringexperienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over thenext few months. Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, inparticular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said. Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exceptionof the agro-food industry, improved substantially. In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised lastmonths. Production rose in all sectors except agriculturalmachinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and shipconstruction, where it declined.

{0 'Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oilindustry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil andhead off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He said also at a news conference that he would recommendto the White House that the fill rate of the StrategicPetroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrelsper day. The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels aday. Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill ratefor the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept downbecause of budgetary constraints. Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he mightadvocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in taxbenefits for oil and gas exploration and for research anddevelopment into new ways to extract oil which is nowconsidered uneconomical to produce. He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of theEnergy Department\'s study on oil\'s impact on national security. Herrington said that before he disclosed whatrecommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industryhe might make, he would raise the matter with the White HouseEconomic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increaseoil production made good tax policy. He said he would like to increase U.S. production by onemln barrels a day. The report said that by the end of the century the UnitedStates may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oilconsumption, posing a serious economic and national securitythreat.

{0 'A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000could have potentially damaging implications for nationalsecurity. The Energy Department study discusses several options tocurb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations. President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruledout a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to helpthe depressed domestic oil industry. Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that\"although we have made gains in energy security in the last sixyears, this report shows that there is justification fornational concern both over declining competitiveness of ourdomestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.\" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report\'s options to ease U.S. reliance on foreignoil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing adetermination that the country never again become captive to aforeign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages andsharp prices increases of the 1970s. The report said an import fee would raise prices and helpmake it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce newoil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax woulddepress the nation\'s economy.

{0 'OPEC believes world oil prices shouldbe set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPECAssistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminarin Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: \"OPEC believes...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictionsand should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.\" But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level hadcaused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced tocurtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPECstates could not be sustained in some cases. \"For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is nowconsidered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its membercountries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailingproduction,\" Al-Wattari said. \"Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,\"Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,some states depended on associated gas output for domestic useand oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below theorganization\'s agreed ceiling for all member countries inFebruary, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,Al-Wattari said. \"A lasting stability in the world marketrequires a wider scope of international cooperation,\" he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown apolitical willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states werepolitically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they wereinsufficient in terms of volume, he added. \"The overall majorityof non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC\'scalls for supply regulation,\" he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as itallowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC tocontinue, while not generating excessive cash flow forotherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a pricewould no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, alsoaddressing the seminar, added that discipline was still neededto prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageousfor both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperationwould ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue. Reuter',1 CRUDE}

The forecast came in the Treasury\'s Financial Statement andBudget Report issued after the Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson\'s annual budget statement to parliament. The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oilrevenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remainingclose to current levels, the Treasury document said. The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall willreflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporationtax is paid after a time lag. The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel differencein oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mlnstg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a fullyear. Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes inproduction would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added. Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are nowestimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts. Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billionstg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of theovershoot. Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year. Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion thisfiscal year.

{0 'The House of Representativesapproved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrainsfarmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive atleast 92 pct of their federal income support payments even ifthey did not plant. The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmersin Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passedby a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate. Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure. USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buyingcrop insurance and fall short of the administration\'s proposedbroad-scale revision of farm programs. The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented fromplanting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of thedeficiency payments they would have received. To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant adifferent crop on that land this spring, although they coulduse the land for grazing or to plant hay. USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,largely because of reduced crop forfeitures. The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producersalong the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were preventedfrom planting crops this year because of residual damage fromlast fall\'s flooding. In addition, the measure would require USDA to make fullpayment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approvedby Congress last fall. Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrsin appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in theregion 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses. The administration said it opposed the bill because, byexpanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwartefforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as analternative to federal disaster assistance.

The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40to 50 mln bushels, it said. The department said government spending on farm programs infiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from1986\'s 25.8 billion dlrs. During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first halfof the 1980\'s will reverse. If current policy remains in force,annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from lastyear\'s record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said. The department said the President\'s budget proposals for1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24billion dlrs. In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remainclose to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pctaverage of 1980-86, it said. Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volumeis expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in sevenyears, the department said. Reuter',1 CORN}

A grain industry representative said some participants were\"puzzled\" by USDA\'s apparent reluctance to bring before thecabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets. \"There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to theidea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,\"this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referringto an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets. This official said there was not a significant amount ofpressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEPoffer to Moscow. Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman PatrickLeahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such anoffer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phonecalls from lawmakers on the subject. But Hofer said other important matters at the White House,rather than an absence of political pressure, might haverestrained Lyng. Reuter',1 WHEAT}

Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger foughtthe planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled SchlumbergerLtd <SLB> to Japan\'s largest computer maker because it couldhave left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources forvital technology. The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time hadcome to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas. \"Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there haveto be some exceptions for the national interest,\" Baldrige wasquoted as saying.

{0 'More U.S. And European firms will befalling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash andeager to extend their reach further overseas, according tomerger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters. Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.Banks, steel and other businesses. In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> -- Japan\'sbiggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for <FairchildSemiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which suppliescomponents for supercomputers. Nomura Securities Co Ltd <NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities CoLtd <DSEC.T>, Japan\'s two largest brokerage firms, are seekinga niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while thecountry\'s huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseasbanking, the takeover specialists said. Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporatingin the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, allhave foreign businesses on their shopping lists. Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the mostpressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big automakers they subcontract for as these move offshore. \"The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy uppotential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --Japan\'s largest market and where political risks are minimal,\" atakeover specialist at one trading company said. Japanese companies have become among the world\'s richestafter a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbedagainst the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months. But the yen\'s strength, which has also raised the costs ofJapan\'s exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move intoits traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,the specialists said. Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect morebarriers against Japanese exports. Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoidthe gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer littleinvestment opportunity. \"Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, butthe recent economic factors have become a driving force,\" said abanking industry source. So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious. While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number inthe thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies havetotalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said. Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japaneseacquisition activity was originally expected five years fromnow, but that time span appeared now to be too long. Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said. A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and ChemicalsInc\'s <DIAC.T> takeover bid for <Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, headded. Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical\'s graphic arts group for550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bidfor the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entirebusiness after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate allbut its graphic arts-related businesses. Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned uponby the Japanese, the trading company official says. \"Japanesepeople don\'t like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicabledeals.\" But now after some experience overseas, Japanesecompanies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. \"This isa healthy progression.\" However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run theboard meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns. \"Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing alarge U.S. Or European corporation,\" one banker said. \"They willexpand their operations only gradually, a typical way forJapanese business.\" A foreign merchant banker also noted, \"There are not manymega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the bigdeals there have already been done.\" But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets ofJapanese companies, the specialists said. Japanese will be aiming for new businesses inhigh-technology areas. \"Japanese companies had used technologyand quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviatefrom that trend,\" one takeover specialist said. Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. Ifthese succeed, activity could build, the specialists said. But few such specialists are going to sit back and waituntil the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese tradinghouses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages andforeign merchant banks have set up research sections to act asgo-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spurdomestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidityon the money market. Many bankers have been urging an average half percentagepoint cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lendingrates, they said. Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan andoverdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, thesources said. Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since earlylast year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The currentgross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank depositand the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade. Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have createdproblems for many banks in managing their money effectively. Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partlybecause of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thaibanking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansionin bank deposits. Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts havefurther buoyed the Thai stock market this week.

Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets dependsbasically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond marketsoverseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there,dealers said. Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said. An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February onmutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bondfutures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move wasmade with yen bond futures trading in mind. LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futuresafter receiving approval from Japan\'s Finance Ministry lastDecember. But futures markets will never take root unless they arebacked by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealerssaid. Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market nowstand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor-linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said. \"Japanese corporations have been actively setting up theirfinancing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly areengaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,\"Dezuka said. The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanesesecurities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. AndU.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market\'sgrowth, dealers said. Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to bepromoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later thisyear, securities managers said. The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to applyto the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bondfutures contract, they said. The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited tradingfutures of designated foreign government debt securities notlocated in the issuing country. Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers\' broker, hasdecided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in NewYork as early as April. CBOT\'s start of an evening session, planned for the end ofApril, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a NomuraSecurities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are stillobstacles to trading on the London market. \"Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing aremajor obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE,\" said KokiChiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd\'sbond administration division. Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanesesecurities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFEon these matters. Japan\'s Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds withcoupon payment of either March and September, or June andDecember from April 1, matching futures delivery months. The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July andDecember. When delivery months and coupon payments do notmatch, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earnedby non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securitiesmanagers said. LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount ofbonds with matching months increases to over several billionyen, bond managers said. These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they areexpected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to lowinterest rates, they said.

{0 'Global trading of yen bond futures isjust around the corner and they are expected to be listed soonon the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said. \"Internationalisation of the yen through expansion ofoverseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success ofglobal trading of yen bond futures,\" said Katsuyuki Okayasu,general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd\'s bond division. \"But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulusfor the LIFFE yen bond futures market,\" said Tetsuya Dezuka,deputy general manager of the money market section of New JapanSecurities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers inLondon. Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets dependsbasically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond marketsoverseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there,dealers said. Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said. An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February onmutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bondfutures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move wasmade with yen bond futures trading in mind. LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futuresafter receiving approval from Japan\'s Finance Ministry lastDecember. But futures markets will never take root unless they arebacked by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealerssaid. Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market nowstand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor-linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said. \"Japanese corporations have been actively setting up theirfinancing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly areengaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,\"Dezuka said. The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanesesecurities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. AndU.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market\'sgrowth, dealers said. Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to bepromoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later thisyear, securities managers said. The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to applyto the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bondfutures contract, they said. The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited tradingfutures of designated foreign government debt securities notlocated in the issuing country. Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers\' broker, hasdecided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in NewYork as early as April. CBOT\'s start of an evening session, planned for the end ofApril, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a NomuraSecurities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are stillobstacles to trading on the London market. \"Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing aremajor obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE,\" said KokiChiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd\'sbond administration division. Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanesesecurities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFEon these matters. Japan\'s Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds withcoupon payment of either March and September, or June andDecember from April 1, matching futures delivery months. The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July andDecember. When delivery months and coupon payments do notmatch, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earnedby non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securitiesmanagers said. LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount ofbonds with matching months increases to over several billionyen, bond managers said. These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they areexpected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to lowinterest rates, they said. Market participants here expect a clearing organisation tobe set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cashissues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of1987.

Sony will have an irregular five-month business term endingMarch 31, as its financial year will be changed to run fromApril 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.

The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yenin the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct froma year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct. The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen\'s recentappreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in marketprices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad. The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,reducing the company\'s total sales in the three month period by40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.

{0 '<General Partners>, controlled byprivately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, saidit has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorpInc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rightsfor 100 dlrs a share. GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day. In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said theoffer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended. General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receiptof sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully dilutedbasis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners atleast 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted. It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeemingthe defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied thatthe rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtainingfrom the Federal Communications Commission a special temporaryauthorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorpshares. General Partners said it would set up voting trustarrangements pending review of its long-form application forFCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp\'sbroadcasting subsidiary. The partnership said the offer is further conditioned onGenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend thecompany\'s articles of incorporation and code of regulations toprovide for an increase in authorized common shares, aclassified board of directors and the elimination of cumulativevoting. The latter two changes would make it harder forminority shareholders to elect directors. General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for itsshareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer. GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making thevalue of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs. Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire<Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew theoffer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of theTax Reform Act of 1986. Lear Siegler eventually went privatefor 1.66 billion dlrs. GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospaceas well as broadcasting. The company faces challenges to itstwo television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase itfailed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreignpayments and political contributions. GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area televisionstation WOR to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its LosAngeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license wouldalso receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.

This trend had been reversed recently and with domesticcredit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stockgrowth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.

{0 'Malaysia\'s state oil company Petronaswill cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) fromMay 1, trade sources said. Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct lastSeptember to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latestcut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986\'s target level. Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its10 pct production cutback until mid-1987. However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual reportthat Malaysia\'s crude oil output was expected to rise to anaverage 510,000 bpd in 1987. The ministry\'s forecast assumed average 1987 crude pricesat 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permitfurther production cutbacks, the sources said. Malaysia\'s benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bblthis year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said. Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add tothe tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reducedIndonesian and Chinese crude output. The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, asthere is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases dueto the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said. In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering twoto three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each monthfor sale through tender, the sources said.

{0 'West German commercial banks arecautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, bankingsources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after theBundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than theusual interim period. A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cuttingleading savings rate for private customers on a regional basisby 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bankfuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally. The delay was partly due to commercial banks\' desire togauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savingsbanks. A fall in customer savings because of lower rates couldreduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them todraw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, oneeconomist at the German Banking Association said. But the volume of savings funds may not be substantiallyundercut by lower savings rates because many customers areparking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvestthem at higher yields in the future, he said. He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move morefunds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-datedsecurities to reduce strong growth in its central bank moneysupply aggregate. The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,unchanged from January.

{0 'Audi AG <NSUG.F>, the 99 pct ownedsubsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fellby around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previousyear. Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a newsconference he expected both profit and turnover to rise thisyear compared with 1986, but he said it was questionablewhether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels. He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted lastyear that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecifiedamount from 1985\'s record levels. Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10billion this year. Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help theparent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audiwould ensure VW got a share of profits. Audi\'s entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own freereserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 yearsVW had received 80 pct of Audi\'s earnings as a dividend. Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to outputcaused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, oncurrency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. Aboutalleged \"sudden acceleration\" of some of its Audi 5000 models. As reported, Audi\'s sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pctto 59,800 last year. Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottomout in 1987. Audi\'s worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000. Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180in 1985. Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in thefirst two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overallmarket share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in thesame months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Salesfell further, he said without giving details. Worldwidedeliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to57,000. Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise toover 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallencompared with 1985\'s 392,000. Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead tofurther new hiring of employees. At the end of 1986 Audi\'s workforce stood at a record39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985. REUTER',1 EARN}

{0 'Most of the cattle now being placed onU.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain onfeed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattleprices through the summer because of reduced beef supply. The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for alonger time blunted the market impact of the high placementsreported in the USDA\'s latest cattle on feed report, livestockanalysts said. After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed inseven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade hadexpected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago. Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts notedreports that many cattle put on feed were relativelylightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lightercattle into the autumn, rather than market them during thesummer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normallyplaced on feed. Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult toobtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledgethat lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas. The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots,helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month fromFebruary, 1986. University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimessaid, \"The probabilities are high that in order to place thatmany cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go tolighter-weight cattle. The only statistics available are from some terminalmarkets which represent only a small percentage of the totalcattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbsin February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said. Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed,Grimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced. If the average weight is down, and there is no priceweakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed atlighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much asthree pct. Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerlyLBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainlybecause of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattleprices. Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grainsupplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattleprices have been encouraging early movement of cattle fromwheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said. Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheatpasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions. Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann andGraham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trendis to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in hisarea benefited from a dry, mild winter. To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter andsome cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs lessthan normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter. Reuter',1 L-CATTLE}

{0 'Silver looks \"unlikely to break out ofgold and platinum\'s shadow\" in the near future, although thisyear is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate thansupply, a study by Credit Suisse said. The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850tonnes from last year\'s provisional 1,100 tonnes. The study noted that the effects of last year\'s lowerprices were having a dampening effect on total supply, whichwas now back down to around levels of a decade ago. However, the study said that primary production, likely toreach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls. Around a third of silver production comes from heavilyindebted Mexico and Peru. Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that themajority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.

{0 'Japan\'s ailing shipbuilding industryplans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks ofrecession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cutsand greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters. The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsoredrationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of themarket which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Koreathrough currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said. The sources said South Korea\'s yards are now some 35 pctmore competitive than Japan\'s due to such factors. The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct ofcurrent capacity within two years through mergers andregrouping under legislation put before Parliament this monthand likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said. They said from September a semi-government body will assurerepayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurredthrough job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment. Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan appliedto the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnagebuilt to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1. The commission has held several hearings with the industryand approval should be given this month, the sources said. A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with aplanned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state supportshould help Japanese yards recover their internationalcompetitiveness, they said. Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable ofbuilding ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build amaximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity. This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced mostyards to sign orders below cost, the sources said. The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said. The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between1986 and 1989. Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd\'sRegister of Shipping. However, falling orders and declining internationalcompetitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses inthe industry, the sources said. Four of Japan\'s six major heavy machinery and shipbuildingcompanies reported current deficits in the first half of theyear to March 31 and five of them are expected to reportcurrent deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said. The shipbuilding companies\' streamlining program will raiseproductivity to compete with South Korean yards which have alsobeen hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recntyears, the sources said. In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting infierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. Thetwo largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T>and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> --account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said. \"World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride outthe recession as their technology is the best in the world,\"said an official at a major Japanese shipping company. The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia\'s,has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said. REUTER',1 SHIP}

{0 'The government announced a three billionfranc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculationamong political and economic analysts that it is positioningitself for a period of economic reflation. The package presented to the cabinet of Prime MinisterJacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister PhilippeSeguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franccontingency fund announced on February 25. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out areflationary program. Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work formore than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one thirdof French unemployed, government figures show. The main measures of the employment program give employersfinancial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of atleast two years and stress retraining to help the long-termunemployed return to the labour market. Training subsidies and exemptions from social securitycontributions are the main incentives for employers. \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strongincentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labourmarket and that\'s why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide toSeguin said. The analysts said speculation the government is consideringa reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman DenisBaudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generallyagreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy. He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling outeconomic stimulation despite the government\'s revision of its1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8. Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin\'sremarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulatethe economy through a boost to consumer spending althoughgovernment policy allowed for increased industrial investmentfrom the proceeds of France\'s five-year privatisation plan. The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenuefrom privatisation, to be split between repaying national debtand providing state enterprises with fresh capital. Some political analysts said Baudouin\'s comments possiblyreflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition onsocial issues ahead of next year\'s presidential elections. Divisions began to show last December, when a wave ofstrikes led by transport workers paralysed the country anddrove the government into a new mood of conciliation withlabour. Officials said that after the success of the privatisationof Cie de Saint Gobain <SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas<PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-yearprivatisation program with the aim of completing a third of itthis year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in1988. The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgetedrevenue to boost industrial and research investment andspending on infrastructure such as the national motorwaynetwork. The government also today revived a proposal, blocked lastyear by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encouragemore flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs byimproving the competitiveness of French industry. The proposals allowing night-shift work by women andvariations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be putto parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoedfor procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council ofState.

{0 'The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drillinglast year are rapidly deflating the United State\'s natural gasbubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies nextwinter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analystssaid. Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity thatis difficult and costly to import in large quantities, couldmore than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by1990, some analysts said. The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilitiesand big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence ofactivity in the Gulf of Mexico\'s offshore waters where some ofthe nation\'s largest gas reserves are located. \"We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,\" saidJames Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. \"Manycompanies appear to be switching from oil to gas drillingbecause they\'re betting that the gas market will be back inbalance in a year or two.\" The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome newsfor drilling and oilfield service companies that barelysurvived last year\'s plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs abarrel to less than half that. Today\'s relatively stable oilprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur areturn to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rigcount soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfieldroustabouts commanded premium wages. The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co <HT> rig count, abarometer of the oil industry\'s health, showed 761 U.S. rigsactive in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year. In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 butdived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oilprices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times. Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said \"In 1986, the UnitedStates replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and thatreplacement rate won\'t be any better this year.\" He added, \"We don\'t have the options we do with oil.Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity andimporting liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasiblein the next 10 years because of the cost.\" Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserveswere discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates. George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Coagreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for anew cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling. \"We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need todedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no laterthan mid-1988,\" Gaspar said. Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging thatcould last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig countto peak near 2,000 in December of 1989. Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to beconducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, wherefederal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to thegovernment unless drilling begins in the next two or threeyears. Some of the industry\'s biggest companies, such as ExxonCorp <XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum havealready indicated plans to increase spending for drilling laterthis year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said. For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont <DD> subsidiary, willspend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico\'s deepestproduction platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet ofgas per day. But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas andKansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership <MLP> inrecent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry ison the verge of a recovery. Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do. \"The rigs won\'t go back to work until the price of oil getsabove 30 dlrs a barrel,\" said Pickens, 58, adding he did notexpect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime. Tenneco Inc <TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.

{0 'Latin American sugar producersare awaiting further rises in world market prices before movingto boost production, official and trade sources said. Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below theregion\'s nine to ten cents per lb average production cost. The recent rise in prices has placed producers on thealert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of LatinAmerican and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),told Reuters. However, Rico said, it would require another five to sevencents to stimulate notable increases in output. \"Producers are taking measures for increasing theirproduction when the prices are profitable,\" he said. Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continuedrise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leadersin Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go. \"The prices are ridiculous,\" said Julian Mateo, vicepresident of Costa Rica\'s Sugar Cane Industrial-AgriculturalLeague. \"At current prices nobody is going to considerincreasing production.\" Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasingoutput, given the instability of world markets. An official at Colombia\'s National Association of SugarCane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.\"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yetgiving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modifyanything.\" In 1985, the latest year for which full figures areavailable, Central and South American nations produced 28 mlntonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. Ayear earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000more, according to the London-based International SugarOrganization. Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugarindustry in many countries in the region into a recession fromwhich it will be hard to recover. Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic\'sNational Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boostproduction even if prices recovered sharply. Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transportand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any shortterm recovery in output, he added. Plans of nearby Cuba, the world\'s largest cane sugarexporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the endof the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output isrunning well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970. Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problemsand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countriesunder special deals. Last year, bad weather added to itstroubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in1985. The low world prices of recent years have led manycountries in the region to cut exportable production to levelswhere they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbeancountries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for whichthey receive prices well above free market levels. Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led toproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted tothe free world market. Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. Inboth 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this yearits quota is only 37,000. A national cooperative official said that, as long as worldmarket levels continue at around half of Peru\'s productioncost, the future of the industry is uncertain. At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officialsstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar canewhich, according to the group\'s executive-secretary EduardoLatorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region. Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane inexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined intosugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency. The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and AlcoholInstitute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives fromforeign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year. Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over thepast year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meantBrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments tonext year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking pointbeing how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery ofsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which wouldcost eight cents to replace. Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar exportsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, withthe Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages ofeither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuilddepleted reserve stockpiles. However, the situation could change dramatically if theeconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps. Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold littlehope for the region\'s sugar industry to return to profitabilityunless the U.S. And EC change their policies. \"The agricultural policies of the European Community and ofthe United States have caused our economies incalculable harmby closing their markets, by price deterioration ininternational commerce and furthermore by the unfaircompetition in third countries,\" Brazil\'s Trade and IndustryMinister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEAmeeting. The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA forwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excessoutput on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is themain cause of low prices. GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement whichwould regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling theregion\'s industry out of steady decline. Such an agreementwould have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialisedcountries would have to see it as a political rather than amerely economic pact. \"They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay theregion\'s 360 billion dollar foreign debt,\" GEPLACEA\'s Latorresaid.

{0 'The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tenderoffer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not beenough to buy the company, analysts said. Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from GeneralPartners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value ofGenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said uncertaintysurrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges toGencorp broadcasting licenses. Gencorp\'s stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading. \"The expectation is either there will be someone else orthe bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management\'scooperation,\" said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Huttongroup. Analysts said there is concern about challenges toGencorp\'s broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radiostations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign paymentsand political contributions. \"I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,\"said Baker of the offer. Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issuemight be a stumbling block or result in a long period of timefor any transaction. A source close to General Partners, however, said GeneralPartners would apply to the Federal Communications Commissionfor special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.The source said if approved, the authority would allow atransaction to be carried out. If it received the \"short-form\" approval, General Partnerswould set up a trust which would hold the broadcastingproperties until the licensing situation is resolved. General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner andBrown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc. Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such asGeneral Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution ofthe challenges since it would carry out GenCorp\'s plan to sellthe stations. GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with WaltDisney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to agroup that challenged the station\'s license. GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV inSecaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs. General Partners said it intends to keep the company\'splastics and industrial products businesses and its tires andrelated products segment. Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, saidthat, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth asmuch as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospacebusiness could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billiondlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs pershare, he said. The company, formerly known as General Tireand Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would beworth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottlingbusiness might also be worth several dollars per share, hesaid. Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, whobecame chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company\'sAerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over theyears and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve. \"The management\'s doing a very fine job in trying to dealwith the non-strategic assets of the company,\" Rose said. Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, butthey declined to predict what steps the company might take.They said it would be possible the company might consider aleveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer. General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and therewas some concern about \"greenmail.\" Greenmail is the payment ata premium for an unwanted shareholders\' stock. \"I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothingsurprises me anymore,\" said Rose. GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retainedFirst Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers. Reuter',1 ACQ}

{0 'Continental Illinois Corp\'s <CIL>Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations toreschedule Brazil\'s debt payments taking at least three to sixmonths. Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment ofinterest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium isexpected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talksare under way. \"I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil\'sdebt,\" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing. \"I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Justhow long the run is is anybody\'s guess,\" Swearingen said. Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil\'s moritoriummay force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrsand reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the firstquarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year. The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize theseloans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of theContinental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,Continental\'s largest subsidiary, said in response to aninquiry. Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and netincome equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use. Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducingoffice rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions. In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts ashare, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share. The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans andother assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the1984 restructuring agreement with the government. The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that itis entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate lossrather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans. In 1986 the bank\'s loans to the Midwest\'s middle marketrose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S. Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bankwould like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 itbought three small suburban banks. Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will betaken over because no bank in the Midwest region is largeenough to buy it, and New York money center banks areprohibited by law from buying Illinois banks. He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over whowill eventually own the firm because it still holds theequivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln. The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and hassaid it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. Theagency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984bailout of the bank. Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head thestruggling banking firm after a career as an oil industryexecutive, said he will retire when the three-year period heagreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would notcomment on a successor. The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago optionsclearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said itsdoubtful lending to Japan will occur because that countrydoesn\'t need external sources of cash.

{0 'The European Community (EC) haswarned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough tradelegislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S.trading partners. The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, headof the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters. Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backedaspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under theGATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry. But Denman disagreed with other provisions which wouldrequire President Reagan to take retaliatory trade actionagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. andwould set new standards for judging unfair foreign tradepractices. Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibitmember nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action intrade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved. He said \"If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,then the United States would be in violation of itsinternational legal obligations and on a collision course withits major trading partners.\" Denman added that a president should have flexibility inenforcing trade laws, saying \"in the last resort, anyadministration must take its decision in light of the overallnational interest.\" Otherwise, he said, \"the risk would be counter-reaction bytrading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation orenactment of mirror image legislation to be employed againstimports from the United States.\" Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if itreduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier forfirms to file unfair trade practice claims. Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standardsfor findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms. \"Changes in these standards must be agreed uponmultilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United Statesalone on the world trading system,\" he said. House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-statelegislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curbimports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed twoyears ago but vetoed by President Reagan. There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto theentire trade bill because of the textile amendment. Reuter',1 TRADE}

(Jim)Nugent told Reuters. \"It reflects their (the executives) belief that they areseeing the bottom of the economic cycle,\" he added, \"and withjust a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to moveagain.\" The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oilprices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 toas low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied toaround 18 dlrs a barrel. At the same time, a number of company executives testifiedthat the nation\'s domestic exploration and production segmentwas still hurting and in need of government help.

Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigsoperating in the United States compared with an average ofnearly 2,000 in 1985. Citing a study released yesterday by the Department ofEnergy, many said the falling production of domestic oilcoupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growingdependency on imports, particularly from the politicallyvolatile Middle East. \"In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lowerprices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day(bpd),\" said J.S.

The utility said these totals exclude spending on NewEngland Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricityfrom Quebec Hydro.

The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mlndlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmissionlines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said. New England Electric said internally generated funds willcover all of its power plant construction costs this year and65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units planto spend in 1987.

The company said it does not plan to offer common sharesthis year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raiseabout 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under itsdividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans. President Samuel Huntington told the analysts theconstruction spending projection is based on the expectationthat demand for electricity in the New England electric systemwill grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years. However, the utility cannot ignore the potential forsharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years. He attributed this growth to declining electricity pricesand a strong New England economy.

Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unitacquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlawpresident Michael de Groote told analysts. Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.

He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does notinclude possible further acquisitions and said that theaddition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988through fiscal 1990. De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous fourquarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. Therest came from acquisitions, he said. Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this willnot make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said. He also said he is \"not very optimistic\" about the ongoingnegotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-basedchemical and solid waste services company with Canadian andU.S. operations, from <Trimac Ltd> of Calgary. De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of theproposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within thenext 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemicalwaste business through GSX Corp. \"We feel it is a profitable business with good growthpotential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the rightmanagement,\" de Groote said. Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing. De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs incash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.

The nation\'s 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985\'s record 18.1billion dlrs. The total was still the second highest ever reported, butit was the first time income had not grown since 1961. The figures reflected a radical split in the health ofbanks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said. In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, whileone in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses. Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDICsaid in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profilesit planned to issue. \"I don\'t remember a time when there was such a cleardistinction by geographic area,\" FDIC Chairman William Seidmantold reporters. He said that while the figures were not good, they showedthe problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole butwith regional differences in economic performance. Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as manyas failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubtedthe pace would continue. On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in thenumber of new problem banks in all regions except theSouthwest, Seidman said. Banks\' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourthquarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from ayear ago. Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs ormore -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDICsaid. Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil\'smoratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.

Wagner told a news conference that last year\'s 34.3 pctrise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due togreater domestic business and wider margins on schillinginterest rates. The bank, Austria\'s third largest, raised its 1986 dividendto 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capitalfrom 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.

Foreigncurrency business last year accounted for some 37 pct ofbalance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985. Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign businesschiefly on the dollar\'s fall against the schilling, which iseffectively pegged to the mark. The dollar\'s weakness had wipedsome 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total. Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits fromthe bank\'s London branch, which opened in April 1985, but saidthat it came close to one mln stg.

{0 'Air Canada\'s 54 mln U.S. dlracquisition of Gelco Corp\'s <GEC> Canadian unit hasdramatically altered Canada\'s fast growing courier industry,largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, companyofficials and analysts said. State-owned Air Canada takes over the country\'s secondlargest overnight courier business just two months afteranother Canadian company, <Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved theacquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from NewJersey-based Purolator Courier Corp <PCC>. But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted byfinancial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companiesand likely don\'t represent an industry trend toward buying outforeign owned courier operations. \"It\'s a case of whether you can buy from the right people atthe right time,\" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analystTony Hine commented. The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-offtheir Canadian units to generate ready cash, said NesbittThomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin. \"There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parentselling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either beingunder siege or taking someone else over,\" he said. Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltdas part of its previously announced program to sell off fouroperating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, GelcoExpress marketing vice president James O\'Neil told Reuters. The sale is the first under Gelco\'s divestiture program,and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs ofdebt by year-end, the company said. While company officials declined to disclose earnings andrevenue figures, O\'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominantposition in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages aday and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrsa year. The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unitformed an important part of a company restructuring program,adopted after another Canadian Company, <Unicorp Canada Corp>,acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it wouldconsider acquiring the whole company. Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a companyformed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers ofPurolator\'s U.S. courier business. For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco\'s Canadian courierbusiness represents an \"excellent financial investment\" in amarket it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesmanEsther Szynkarsky said. The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake inEMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service. It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky saidthe two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, andthe two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs. She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada\'s strategy ofseeking attractive investments that compliment its main airlinebusiness. Gelco will continue to operate with current management,independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada alreadyoperates its own air cargo business that includes a smalldoor-to-door courier operation. \"They\'re well run, they\'re a good investment, they\'re doingwell in a growing market, and that\'s the way we want to keepit,\" Szynkarsky said. Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian unitswill likely retain operating links with their U.S. deliverynetwork, generating traffic for the former parent companieswithout them having to tie up capital in Canada. \"The nature of the business is that incremental traffic isincremental revenue,\" Hine said. \"It\'s sort of a sausage maker business where you put inplace the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuffthrough, the more money you make,\" he added.

Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that\"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we\'veonly altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs forthe year.\" Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling andexploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil outputwill not take place as the companies are waiting for stableprices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration. John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony toCongress said \"The continuing decline in U.S. oil production isvirtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. Butthe future rate of decline is very much a function of world oilprices and U.S. government policy.\" Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oilproduction but would only work over time. \"Lowering the producing industry\'s tax burden would probablybe a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase butwould not raise energy costs.\" Lichtblau said. But the small independent oil companies who do much of thedrilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate reliefwhich could be brought on by an oil import fee. Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the InternationalAssociation of Drilling Contractors, said, \"The members of ourtrade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oilimport fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect ournation.\" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oilservice companies. The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import feewill face a stiff uphill battle. Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January bya former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oilimport fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as ameans of protecting the domestic petroleum industry. At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyedopposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff wouldhurt consumers and some regional interests. But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could growif production continued to fall and imports to rise. Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements\"is a critical, symbolic level.

{0 'The U.S. Congress and the oil industryare deeply divided on ways the government should assist theindustry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and thesubsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said. \"The industry is deeply divided between those who support anoil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,\"said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy ResearchAssociates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.Congress on energy issues. Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for taxincentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.

{0 'Argentine grain growers reducedtheir estimates for maize and soybean production in the currentharvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reachbetween 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnesestimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated inmid-February. But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7pct greater than last year\'s total of 7.1 mln tonnes, accordingto official figures, and would be a new record. The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was arecord 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pctcompared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year. The change in yield estimates is due to very hightemperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year inthe soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe andnorthern Buenos Aires province. The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybeanpods empty, especially in Cordoba. Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, sincerainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas. Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak inBuenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. Therewas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces. With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields wereable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recentweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,sunflower and sorghum harvesting. Crops were considered in generally good condition, thoughit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains ofrecent weeks caused any long-term damage. The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of thetotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago. Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85mln hectares planted in the previous harvest. Total production for the current maize harvest is expectedto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mlntonnes estimated a week ago.

{0 'Fleet Financial Group hopes itsproposed merger with Norstar Bancorp <NOR>, ranked as thelargest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginningof 1988, according to an executive of Fleet. Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications forRhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploringthe possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger datefor the state\'s reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from Julyone. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature. The merger plan was announced in a midday news release thatsaid the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would beconsummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstatebanking outside of New England come down. \"If we can consummatethe deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,\"Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change inthe Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any otherbanking institution in the state. He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which onlypermits interstate banking mergers within New England, can beamended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp. If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchaseprovisions. The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded NewYork as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbledup by the money center giants. Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleetand Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace ofinterstate banking mergers since state legislatures begainpermitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers. Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposedmerger as \"a partnership of two companies.\" Both will continueto operate existing headquarters after the merger. Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each oneof theirs following Fleet\'s previously announced two-for-onesplit. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving thedeal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs. That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-basedSecurity Pacific Corp <SPC> and Seattle\'s Rainier Bancorpartion<RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, isworth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs. Chemical New York Corp\'s <CHL> acquisition of TexasCommerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billiondlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainerdeal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co <WFC>and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrsand there have been several bank mergers in the southeastvalued in the 700-800 mln dlr range. \"It\'s a merger of equals,\" said analyst John Rooney ofMoseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value atthe end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet\'s bookvalue was 28.02 dlrs. Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his60\'s while Fleet\'s Terrence Murray is in his late 40\'s. He saidKiernan would probably head the combined company until hisretirement then Murray could assume the top post. Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co saidFleet\'s earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986on the basis of the merger terms announced today. He noted that Fleet has a \"teriffic reputation\" afterhaving diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet hasestablished consumer banks in the southeast and is known as aninnovator in securitization of mortgages. The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billiondlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S. Norstaroperates in most of New York state but not in New York City. Lougee said at some point in the future banking operationsthat both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine wouldbe combined.

Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break outof the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar hasstabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conductmonetary policy. But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, thedollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attractedeager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said. In addition to a changing perception about the dollar andmonetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinnsaid the beginning of April could bring foreign investors backinto the marketplace. \"The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at thebeginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,\" Quinn said. Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there arelarge amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japaneseinvestment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start ofJapan\'s fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bondmarket, he said. \"We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bringyields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct,\" compared tothe current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.

Other members of the MDP, which includes the communistparty and a faction of the socialist party, took five of theprincipal positions on the union\'s directorate. The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) producesaround 90 pct of the country\'s copper output of some one mlntonnes per year.

Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of foodaid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to graduallyincrease over three years to 75 pct in 1988.

Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running atabout three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on SaudiArabia\'s OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC\'snew-found determination to defend prices in a move Westerndiplomats believe underlines the kingdom\'s need to secure astable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia, still the world\'s largest oil exporter, is ahugely wealthy country. But the past five years of decliningrevenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate grossdomestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billiondlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981. \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will notbe allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis canafford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worsteffects,\" a diplomat said. In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact oflower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing onforeign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankersand diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness inthe longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at atime when the government is publicly urging private enterpriseto take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware ofthe risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough itout\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletionof reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billionriyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitlyrecognises the need to draw down reserves while foreignborrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudibusinessmen this week the government had carefully consideredthe need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budgetplans late last year. \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into theeconomy,\" he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970\'s and early1980\'s when Saudi Arabia\'s breakneck pace of construction andtales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in thefabric of the Kingdom\'s private sector where poor managementhad gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cutback. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining butSaudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporatesector, have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigatecompany complaints about late public sector contract paymentscould boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation\'sindustrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more andmore cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economicdevelopment from the public to the private sector, one of thebiggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channelpersonal savings into industrial projects within the kingdomand refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

{0 'The rebate granted at yesterday\'s ECsugar tender represents some concession to producers\'complaints that they are losing money on exports outside thebloc, EC Commission officials said. The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus)per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is neededto obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales intointervention. The rebate at last week\'s tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilosshort of the level producers said was needed, the officialssaid. The officials said the Commission is not negotiating withproducers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugarfor sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuadeit to offer higher rebates. They said the French and German producers involved are nowunable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugarwill officially enter intervention stores. Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be opento them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1and the official payment date when the Commission officiallytakes ownership of the sugar, the officials said. The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar,it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which woulddrive down market prices further. They expressed some hope that the operators would noteventually go through with their plan for intervention sales. \"We think they realise they have gone too far,\" one officialsaid. REUTER',1 SUGAR}
